1
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:24,370
I killed Sirius Black!

2
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:30,800
He's back.

3
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:57,520
The police are
continuing with the investigation...

4
00:02:57,690 --> 00:02:59,730
...into the cause
of the Millennium Bridge disaster.

5
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:03,600
Traffic has been halted
as police search for survivors.

6
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:05,440
The surrounding area remains closed.

7
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:08,780
The mayor has urged Londoners
to remain calm...

8
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:15,370
" Harry Potter. "

9
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:17,540
Who's Harry Potter?.

10
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:21,080
oh, no one.

11
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:23,010
Bit of a tosser, really.

12
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:27,170
Funny, that paper of yours.

13
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:29,970
Couple nights ago,
I could've sworn I saw a picture move.

14
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:32,930
-Really?.
-Thought I was going around the twist.

15
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:44,240
-Hey, I was wondering-
-Eleven. That's when I get off.

16
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:47,190
You can tell me all about
that tosser Harry Potter.

17
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,320
You've been reckless this summer, Harry.

18
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,790
I like riding around on trains.

19
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,950
Takes my mind off things.

20
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:49,380
Rather unpleasant to behold, isn't it?.

21
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:52,890
The tale is thrilling, if I say so myself.

22
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:55,590
But now is not the time to tell it.

23
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:57,340
Take my arm.

24
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,260
Do as I say.

25
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:12,860
I just Apparated, didn't I?.

26
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:16,200
Indeed. Quite successfully too,
I might add.

27
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:18,990
Most people vomit the first time.

28
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,910
I can't imagine why.

29
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:32,380
Welcome to the
charming village of Budleigh Babberton.

30
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:36,850
Harry, I assume, right about now, you're
wondering why I brought you here.

31
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:38,720
Am I right?.

32
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:42,260
Actually, sir, after all these years,
I just sort of go with it.

33
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:48,650
Wands out, Harry.

34
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,540
Horace?.

35
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,090
Horace?.

36
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:08,640
Merlin's beard!

37
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:12,100
No need to disfigure me, AIbus.

38
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:15,980
Well, I must say you
make a very convincing armchair, Horace.

39
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:21,320
It's all in the upholstery. I come by the
stuffing naturally. What gave me away?.

40
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:24,150
Dragon's blood.

41
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:27,700
-oh.
oh, yes, introductions.

42
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:31,870
Harry, I'd like you to meet
an old friend and colleague of mine...

43
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,500
...Horace Slughorn.

44
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:35,160
Horace...

45
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:38,130
...well, you know who this is.

46
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:41,000
Harry Potter.

47
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:45,590
What's with all the theatrics, Horace?.

48
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:48,220
You weren't, by any chance,
waiting for someone else?.

49
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:50,850
Someone else?.
I'm sure I don't know what you mean.

50
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:54,760
All right, the Death Eaters have been
trying to recruit me for over a year.

51
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:56,270
Do you know what that's like?.

52
00:07:56,440 --> 00:08:00,190
You can only say no so many times, so
I never stay anywhere more than a week.

53
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:02,690
Muggles who own this
are in the Canary Islands.

54
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:07,740
Well, I think we should put it back
in order for them, don't you?. Mind.

55
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:44,240
That was fun.

56
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:48,240
-Do you mind if I use the loo?.
-No, of course.

57
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:52,250
Don't think I don't know
why you're here, AIbus.

58
00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:57,920
The answer's still no.
Absolutely and unequivocally, no.

59
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:08,380
You're very like your father.

60
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:12,380
-Except for the eyes. You have your-
-My mother's eyes. Yeah.

61
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:16,260
Lily. Lovely Lily. She was
exceedingly bright, your mother.

62
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:19,770
Even more impressive when one
considers she was Muggle-born.

63
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:22,510
one of my best friends is Muggle-born.
Best in our year.

64
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:24,730
Please don't think I'm prejudiced.
No, no.

65
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:29,120
Your mother was one of my
absolute favorites. Look, there she is.

66
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,080
Right at the front.

67
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:42,540
All mine. Each and every one.

68
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:44,790
Ex-students, I mean.

69
00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:51,430
You recognize Barnabas Cuffe,
editor of The Daily Prophet.

70
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:54,800
AIways takes my owl,
should I wish to register an opinion...

71
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:56,260
...on the news of the day.

72
00:09:57,140 --> 00:10:00,100
Gwenog Jones,
captain of the Holyhead Harpies.

73
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:02,730
Free tickets whenever I want them.

74
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:05,900
of course, I haven't been
to a match in some time.

75
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:09,160
Ah, yes.

76
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,480
Regulus Black.

77
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:15,610
You no doubt know of his older brother
Sirius. Died a few weeks ago.

78
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:18,330
I taught the whole Black family,
except Sirius.

79
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,700
It's a shame. Talented boy.

80
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:26,170
I got Regulus when he came along,
of course, but I'd have liked the set.

81
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:28,250
Horace?.

82
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:30,510
Do you mind if I take this?.

83
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:38,720
-I do love knitting patterns.
-Yes, of course. But you're not leaving?.

84
00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:42,010
I think I know a lost cause
when I see one. Regrettable.

85
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:44,480
I would have considered it
a personal triumph...

86
00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:47,600
...had you consented to return
to Hogwarts. oh, well.

87
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:50,780
You're like my friend Mr. Potter here,
one of a kind.

88
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:53,110
Well, bye-bye, Horace.

89
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,440
Bye.

90
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:08,960
All right. I'll do it.

91
00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:13,710
But I want Professor Merrythought's old
office, not the water closet I had before.

92
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:18,100
And I expect a raise.
These are mad times we live in. Mad!

93
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:21,520
They are indeed.

94
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:26,810
Sir, exactly what was all that about?.

95
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:32,060
You are talented, famous and powerful.
Everything Horace values.

96
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:35,650
Professor Slughorn is gonna try
to collect you, Harry.

97
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:38,200
You would be his crowning jewel.

98
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:43,910
That's why he's returning to Hogwarts.
And it's crucial he should return.

99
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:47,740
I fear I may have stolen
a wondrous night from you, Harry.

100
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:52,960
She was, truthfully, very pretty, the girl.

101
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:56,580
It's all right, sir. I'll go back tomorrow,
make some excuse.

102
00:11:56,760 --> 00:12:00,430
oh, you'll not be returning
to Little Whinging tonight, Harry.

103
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:03,600
But, sir, what about Hedwig?.
And my trunk?.

104
00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:06,440
Both are waiting for you.

105
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:41,470
Hedwig.

106
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:45,300
Mum?.

107
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,060
Ginny, what is it?.

108
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,720
I was only wondering
when Harry got here.

109
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:54,150
-What?. Harry?. Harry who?.
-Harry Potter, of course.

110
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,480
I think I'd know if Harry Potter
was in my house, wouldn't I?.

111
00:12:57,650 --> 00:13:01,150
-His trunk's in the kitchen, and his owl.
-No, dear, I seriously doubt that.

112
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:05,440
Harry?. Did someone say "Harry"?.

113
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:07,580
Me, nosy. Is he up there with you?.

114
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:10,780
of course not. I'd know if my best friend
was in my room, wouldn't I?.

115
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:13,450
HERMloNE: Is that an owl?.
You haven't seen him, have you?.

116
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:15,370
He's wandering about the house.

117
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:17,290
Really?.
Really.

118
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:19,130
Harry!

119
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:27,060
Harry!

120
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,800
Hello.

121
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:32,260
What a lovely surprise.

122
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:36,680
Why didn't you let us know
you were coming?.

123
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:39,690
-I didn't know. Dumbledore.
-oh, that man.

124
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:42,100
But then, what would we do
without him?.

125
00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:46,030
Got a bit of toothpaste.

126
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:54,660
So when did you get here?.

127
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:56,540
A few days ago.

128
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:59,790
Though for a while,
I wasn't sure I was coming.

129
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:03,880
Mum sort of lost it last week.

130
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:07,010
Said Ginny and I had no business
going back to Hogwarts.

131
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:08,560
That it's too dangerous.

132
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,560
-oh, come on.
-She's not alone.

133
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:15,060
Even my parents, and they're Muggles,
know something bad's happening.

134
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:19,100
Anyway, Dad stepped in,
told her she was being barmy...

135
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,810
...and it took a few days,
but she came around.

136
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:27,070
But this is Hogwarts we're talking about.
It's Dumbledore. What could be safer?.

137
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:30,950
There's been a lot of talk recently that...

138
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:33,410
...Dumbledore's got a bit old.

139
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:35,370
Rubbish! Well, he's only...

140
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:37,120
What is he?.

141
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:40,500
Hundred and fifty?.
Give or take a few years.

142
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:04,400
Cissy! You can't do this!
He can't be trusted!

143
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:06,030
The Dark Lord trusts him.

144
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:09,780
The Dark Lord's mistaken.
-Pfft.

145
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:41,300
Run along, Wormtail.

146
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:46,810
I know I ought not to be here.

147
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:50,700
The Dark Lord himself
forbade me to speak of this.

148
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:53,530
If the Dark Lord has forbidden it,
you ought not to speak.

149
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:57,950
Put it down, Bella.
We mustn't touch what isn't ours.

150
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:05,780
As it so happens,
I'm aware of your situation, Narcissa.

151
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,130
You?.

152
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:10,500
The Dark Lord told you?.

153
00:16:11,090 --> 00:16:13,630
Your sister doubts me.

154
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:17,510
Understandable. Over the years
I've played my part well.

155
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:21,430
So well, I've deceived
one of the greatest wizards of all time.

156
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:26,770
Dumbledore is a great wizard.
only a fool would question it.

157
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:28,850
I don't doubt you, Severus.

158
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:32,190
You should be honored, Cissy.
As should Draco.

159
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:38,490
He's just a boy.

160
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:42,370
I can't change the Dark Lord's mind.

161
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,670
But it might be possible
for me to help Draco.

162
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:52,340
Severus.
-Swear to it.

163
00:16:56,430 --> 00:16:58,840
Make the Unbreakable Vow.

164
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:05,760
It's just empty words.

165
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:09,140
He'll give it his best effort.

166
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:11,690
But when it matters most...

167
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:17,530
...he'll just slither back into his hole.

168
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:22,620
Coward.

169
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:29,250
Take out your wand.

170
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:43,590
Will you...

171
00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:45,810
...Severus Snape...

172
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:48,890
...watch over Draco Malfoy...

173
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:53,890
...as he attempts to fulfill
the Dark Lord's wishes?.

174
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:56,940
I will.

175
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:01,990
And will you,
to the best of your ability...

176
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:04,870
...protect him from harm?.

177
00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:07,610
I will.

178
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:12,200
And if Draco should fail...

179
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:17,960
...will you yourself carry out the deed...

180
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:23,130
...the Dark Lord
has ordered Draco to perform?.

181
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:29,890
I will.

182
00:18:52,670 --> 00:18:55,670
Step up! Step up!
We've got Fainting Fancies!

183
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:56,870
Nosebleed Nougats!

184
00:18:57,050 --> 00:19:00,130
-And just in time for school...
-Puking Pastilles!

185
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:04,170
-Into the cauldron, handsome.
-Into the cauldron, handsome.

186
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:07,420
FEMALE VolCE:
I will have order!

187
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:11,980
I really hate children. I will have order!

188
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:16,940
I really hate children. I will have order!

189
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:21,030
-Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder.
-A real money spinner, that.

190
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,320
Handy if you need
to make a quick getaway.

191
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:25,230
Hello, ladies.
Hello, ladies.

192
00:19:25,410 --> 00:19:28,690
-Love potions, eh?.
-Yeah, they really do work.

193
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:32,200
Then again, the way we hear it, sis,
you're doing just fine on your own.

194
00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:33,540
Meaning?.

195
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:35,830
Are you not
currently dating Dean Thomas?.

196
00:19:36,290 --> 00:19:38,040
It's none of your business.

197
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:44,830
How much for this?.

198
00:19:45,010 --> 00:19:46,390
-Five Galleons.
-Five Galleons.

199
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:48,680
-How much for me?.
-Five Galleons.

200
00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:50,050
I'm your brother.

201
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:52,470
-Ten Galleons.
-Ten Galleons.

202
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:56,050
Come on, let's go.

203
00:19:58,520 --> 00:19:59,930
Hi, Ron.

204
00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:01,980
Hi.

205
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:19,250
HERMloNE: How are Fred and George
doing it?. Half the Alley's closed down.

206
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:21,990
Fred reckons
people need a laugh these days.

207
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:24,420
I reckon he's right.

208
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:27,790
HERMloNE:
oh, no.

209
00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:30,590
Everyone got their wands
from ollivander's.

210
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:44,440
Harry?.

211
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:48,350
Is it me, or do Draco and Mummy
look like two people...

212
00:20:48,530 --> 00:20:50,240
...who don't want to be followed?.

213
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:36,800
Quibbler.

214
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:40,140
Quibbler.

215
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:46,720
He's lovely. They've been known
to sing on Boxing Day, you know.

216
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:49,270
-Quibbler?
-oh, please.

217
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:53,020
-What's a Wrackspurt?.
-They' re invisible creatures.

218
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:56,360
They float in your ears
and make your brain go fuzzy.

219
00:22:56,910 --> 00:22:58,450
Quibbler.

220
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:11,670
So, what was Draco doing
with that weird-looking cabinet?.

221
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,550
And who were all those people?.

222
00:23:13,710 --> 00:23:16,830
Don't you see?.
It was a ceremony, an initiation.

223
00:23:17,010 --> 00:23:18,920
Stop it, Harry.
I know where you're going.

224
00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:21,590
It's happened. He's one of them.

225
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,260
one of what?.

226
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:27,470
Harry is under the impression
Draco Malfoy is now a Death Eater.

227
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,600
You're barking.

228
00:23:29,770 --> 00:23:31,890
What would You-Know-Who
want with Malfoy?.

229
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:36,110
Well, then what's he doing in Borgin
and Burkes?. Browsing for furniture?.

230
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:38,150
It's a creepy shop. He's a creepy bloke.

231
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:42,190
Look, his father is a Death Eater.
It only makes sense.

232
00:23:42,370 --> 00:23:43,940
Hermione saw it with her own eyes.

233
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:47,450
I told you, I don't know what I saw.

234
00:23:49,170 --> 00:23:50,710
I need some air.

235
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:11,220
Don't worry. When we get
to Hogwarts, we'll sort it out.

236
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:34,870
What was that?. Blaise?.
Don't know.

237
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:38,160
Relax, boys. It's probably just
a first-year messing around.

238
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:41,710
Come on, Draco. Sit down.
We'll be at Hogwarts soon.

239
00:24:51,390 --> 00:24:55,180
Hogwarts.
What a pathetic excuse for a school.

240
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,350
I'd pitch myself off
the Astronomy T ower...

241
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,650
...if I had to continue
for another two years.

242
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:01,150
What's that supposed to mean?.

243
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:06,240
Let's just say you won't see me wasting
my time in Charms class next year.

244
00:25:08,030 --> 00:25:09,860
Amused, Blaise?.

245
00:25:11,330 --> 00:25:13,740
We'll see just who's laughing in the end.

246
00:25:35,890 --> 00:25:39,640
You two go on.
I wanna check something.

247
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:43,100
Where's Harry?.

248
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:46,230
He's probably already on the platform.
Come on.

249
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:05,420
DRACo: Didn't Mummy ever tell you
it was rude to eavesdrop, Potter?.

250
00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:07,170
Petrificus Totalus.

251
00:26:18,390 --> 00:26:19,850
oh, yeah...

252
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:23,560
...she was dead before you could wipe
the drool off your chin.

253
00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:32,240
That's for my father.
Enjoy your ride back to London.

254
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,820
Finite.

255
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:25,240
-Hello, Harry.
-Luna!

256
00:27:25,630 --> 00:27:30,340
-How'd you know where I was?.
-Wrackspurts. Your head's full of them.

257
00:27:37,050 --> 00:27:39,720
Sorry I made you miss
the carriages, by the way, Luna.

258
00:27:39,890 --> 00:27:43,060
That's all right.
It was like being with a friend.

259
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:45,270
oh, I am your friend, Luna.

260
00:27:45,690 --> 00:27:47,480
That's nice.

261
00:27:47,650 --> 00:27:50,850
About time. I've been looking
all over for you two.

262
00:27:51,030 --> 00:27:53,860
Right. Names?.

263
00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:56,490
Professor Flitwick,
you've known me for five years.

264
00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:58,780
No exceptions, Potter.

265
00:27:59,330 --> 00:28:01,070
Who are those people?.

266
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:03,530
Aurors. For security.

267
00:28:03,710 --> 00:28:05,160
What's this cane here, then?.

268
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:07,700
It's not a cane, you cretin.
It's a walking stick.

269
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:11,870
And what exactly would you
be wanting with a...?.

270
00:28:13,050 --> 00:28:16,130
Could be construed
as an offensive weapon.

271
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:21,540
It's all right, Mr. Filch.
I can vouch for Mr. Malfoy.

272
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:30,900
Nice face, Potter.

273
00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:39,770
Would you like me to fix it for you?.

274
00:28:39,950 --> 00:28:43,730
Personally, I think you look
a bit more devil-may-care this way...

275
00:28:43,910 --> 00:28:45,450
...but it's up to you.

276
00:28:45,870 --> 00:28:48,160
Well, have you ever fixed a nose before?.

277
00:28:48,330 --> 00:28:52,030
No, but I've done several toes,
and how different are they, really?.

278
00:28:53,090 --> 00:28:57,000
Um... okay, yeah. Give it a go.

279
00:28:59,430 --> 00:29:01,470
-Episkey.
-Ah!

280
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:10,770
-How do I look?.
-Exceptionally ordinary.

281
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:13,270
Brilliant.

282
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:22,700
Don't worry. He'll be here in a minute.

283
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:29,280
Will you stop eating?.

284
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:31,700
Your best friend is missing!

285
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:35,130
oi. Turn around, you lunatic.

286
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,420
He's covered in blood again.

287
00:29:40,050 --> 00:29:43,830
-Why is it he's always covered in blood?.
-Looks like it's his own this time.

288
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:46,180
Where have you been?.

289
00:29:46,350 --> 00:29:48,800
-What happened to your face?.
-Later.

290
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:50,600
What've I missed?.

291
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:54,930
Sorting Hat urged us all to be brave
and strong in these troubled times.

292
00:29:55,110 --> 00:29:58,640
Easy for it to say, huh?.
It's a hat, isn't it?.

293
00:30:06,490 --> 00:30:08,200
Very best of evenings to you all.

294
00:30:08,370 --> 00:30:09,400
Thanks.

295
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:16,280
First off, let me introduce
the newest member of our staff...

296
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:18,700
...Horace Slughorn.

297
00:30:22,590 --> 00:30:24,470
Professor Slughorn, I'm happy to say...

298
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:28,930
...has agreed to resume
his old post as Potions Master.

299
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:32,020
Meanwhile, the post of
Defense Against the Dark Arts...

300
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:33,980
...will be taken by Professor Snape.

301
00:30:34,390 --> 00:30:35,850
Snape?.

302
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:43,530
Now, as you know...

303
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:47,360
...each and every one of you was searched
upon your arrival here tonight.

304
00:30:47,530 --> 00:30:49,530
And you have the right to know why.

305
00:30:50,330 --> 00:30:53,910
once there was a young man,
who, like you...

306
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:56,540
...sat in this very hall...

307
00:30:56,920 --> 00:31:01,540
...walked this castle's corridors,
slept under its roof.

308
00:31:02,130 --> 00:31:06,510
He seemed to all the world
a student like any other.

309
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:08,220
His name?.

310
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:11,010
Tom Riddle.

311
00:31:16,190 --> 00:31:17,850
Today, of course...

312
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:21,730
...he's known all over the world
by another name.

313
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:28,110
Which is why, as I stand looking out
upon you all tonight...

314
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:30,650
...I'm reminded of a sobering fact.

315
00:31:31,830 --> 00:31:34,950
Every day, every hour...

316
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:37,080
...this very minute, perhaps...

317
00:31:37,250 --> 00:31:41,580
...dark forces attempt to penetrate
this castle's walls.

318
00:31:43,210 --> 00:31:48,750
But in the end,
their greatest weapon is you.

319
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,930
Just something to think about.

320
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:56,760
Now, off to bed. Pip-pip.

321
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:00,230
That was cheerful.

322
00:32:05,530 --> 00:32:10,270
History of Magic is upstairs,
ladies, not down.

323
00:32:11,070 --> 00:32:16,070
Mr. Davies! Mr. Davies!
That is the girls' lavatory.

324
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:20,280
Potter.

325
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:23,580
oh, this can't be good.

326
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,250
Enjoying ourselves, are we?.

327
00:32:29,170 --> 00:32:32,380
-I had a free period this morning.
-So I noticed.

328
00:32:32,890 --> 00:32:35,290
I would think you would want to
fill it with Potions.

329
00:32:35,470 --> 00:32:38,140
or is it no longer your ambition
to become an Auror?.

330
00:32:38,930 --> 00:32:42,550
It was, but I was told I had to
get an "outstanding" in my o.W.L.

331
00:32:42,730 --> 00:32:45,600
So you did, when Professor Snape
was teaching Potions.

332
00:32:45,770 --> 00:32:50,350
However, Professor Slughorn is perfectly
happy to accept N.E.W.T.s students...

333
00:32:50,530 --> 00:32:52,320
...with "Exceeds Expectations. "

334
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:54,480
Brilliant. Um...

335
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:57,110
-Well, I'll head there straightaway.
-oh, good, good.

336
00:32:57,280 --> 00:33:02,200
Potter, take Weasley with you.
He looks far too happy over there.

337
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,280
I don't wanna take Potions.

338
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:08,160
This is Quidditch trials coming up.
I need to practice.

339
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:11,380
Attention to detail
in the preparation...

340
00:33:11,550 --> 00:33:13,840
...is the prerequisite of all planning.

341
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:16,720
Ah.

342
00:33:16,890 --> 00:33:20,800
Harry, my boy, I was beginning to worry.
We've brought someone with us, I see.

343
00:33:21,430 --> 00:33:22,630
Ron Weasley, sir.

344
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:25,640
But I'm dead awful at Potions,
a menace, actually.

345
00:33:25,810 --> 00:33:27,890
-I'm gonna...
Nonsense, we'll sort you out.

346
00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:31,150
Any friend of Harry's is a friend of mine.
Get your books out.

347
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:33,860
I haven't actually got
my book yet, and nor has Ron.

348
00:33:34,030 --> 00:33:35,740
Get what you want from the cupboard.

349
00:33:35,910 --> 00:33:39,240
Now, as I was saying,
I prepared some concoctions this morning.

350
00:33:39,410 --> 00:33:43,360
Any ideas what these might be?.

351
00:33:44,870 --> 00:33:47,450
-Y es, Miss...?.
-Granger, sir.

352
00:33:50,710 --> 00:33:55,170
That one there is Veritaserum.
It's a truth-telling serum.

353
00:33:55,340 --> 00:33:58,050
And that would be Polyjuice Potion.

354
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:03,340
It's terribly tricky to make.

355
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:05,560
And this is Amortentia...

356
00:34:05,730 --> 00:34:08,130
...the most powerful
love potion in the world.

357
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:12,890
It's rumored to smell differently to each
person according to what attracts them.

358
00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:16,190
For example, I smell...

359
00:34:16,950 --> 00:34:20,990
...freshly mown grass,
and new parchment, and...

360
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:24,490
...spearmint toothpaste.

361
00:34:25,910 --> 00:34:29,360
Amortentia doesn't create
actual love. That would be impossible.

362
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:34,540
But it does cause
a powerful infatuation or obsession.

363
00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:41,380
And for that reason, it is probably
the most dangerous potion in this room.

364
00:34:46,930 --> 00:34:49,720
Sir?. You haven't told us
what's in that one.

365
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:51,810
oh, yes.

366
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:54,550
What you see before you,
ladies and gentlemen...

367
00:34:54,730 --> 00:35:00,150
...is a curious little potion
known as Felix Felicis.

368
00:35:00,570 --> 00:35:02,810
But it is more commonly referred to as-

369
00:35:02,990 --> 00:35:08,280
-Liquid luck.
-Yes, Miss Granger. Liquid luck.

370
00:35:08,790 --> 00:35:11,790
Desperately tricky to make,
disastrous should you get it wrong.

371
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:17,580
one sip and you will find
that all of your endeavors succeed.

372
00:35:19,630 --> 00:35:22,120
At least until the effects wear off.

373
00:35:22,970 --> 00:35:26,800
So this is what I offer each of you today.

374
00:35:26,970 --> 00:35:31,800
one tiny vial of liquid luck to the student
who, in the hour that remains...

375
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:36,560
...manages to brew an acceptable
Draught of Living Death...

376
00:35:36,730 --> 00:35:39,980
...the recipes for which can be found
on page 10 of your books.

377
00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:43,820
I should point out, however, only once did
a student manage to brew a potion...

378
00:35:43,990 --> 00:35:47,320
...of sufficient quality to claim this prize.

379
00:35:47,990 --> 00:35:50,150
Nevertheless, good luck to you all.

380
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:52,830
Let the brewing commence.

381
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:30,480
How did you do that?.

382
00:36:31,030 --> 00:36:33,190
You crush it. Don't cut it.

383
00:36:33,370 --> 00:36:35,860
No. The instructions
specifically say to cut.

384
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:37,870
No, really.

385
00:37:15,370 --> 00:37:18,540
Merlin's beard! It is perfect.

386
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:23,240
So perfect I daresay
one drop would kill us all.

387
00:37:26,550 --> 00:37:28,500
So here we are, then, as promised.

388
00:37:28,670 --> 00:37:31,880
one vial of Felix Felicis.

389
00:37:32,050 --> 00:37:34,090
Congratulations.

390
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:37,350
Use it well.

391
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:07,630
Harry, you got my message. Come in.

392
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:10,670
How are you?.

393
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:12,380
I'm fine, sir.

394
00:38:12,550 --> 00:38:13,800
Enjoying your classes?.

395
00:38:15,050 --> 00:38:18,090
I know Professor Slughorn
is most impressed with you.

396
00:38:18,810 --> 00:38:21,100
I think he overestimates my abilities, sir.

397
00:38:21,810 --> 00:38:22,920
Do you?.

398
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:24,720
Definitely.

399
00:38:26,730 --> 00:38:29,570
What about your activities
outside the classroom?.

400
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:32,770
-Sir?.
-Well, I notice you spend...

401
00:38:32,950 --> 00:38:35,570
...a great deal of time with Miss Granger.

402
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:36,990
I can't help wondering...

403
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:42,150
oh, no, no. I mean, she's brilliant,
and we're friends, but, no.

404
00:38:42,330 --> 00:38:45,330
Forgive me. I was merely being curious.

405
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:48,290
But enough chitchat.

406
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:52,090
You must be wondering
why I summoned you here tonight.

407
00:38:52,670 --> 00:38:55,510
The answer lies here.

408
00:38:56,510 --> 00:38:58,670
What you are looking at are memories.

409
00:38:58,850 --> 00:39:02,680
In this case,
pertaining to one individual, Voldemort...

410
00:39:02,850 --> 00:39:05,310
...or, as he was known then, Tom Riddle.

411
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:12,190
This vial contains
the most particular memory...

412
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:14,570
...of the day I first met him.

413
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:18,690
I'd like you to see it, if you would.

414
00:39:56,320 --> 00:40:00,570
I admit some confusion upon
receiving your letter, Mr. Dumbledore.

415
00:40:00,910 --> 00:40:04,360
In all the years T om's been here,
he's never once had a family visitor.

416
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:08,280
There have been incidents
with the other children. Nasty things.

417
00:40:10,710 --> 00:40:12,870
T om, you have a visitor.

418
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:15,080
How do you do, T om?.

419
00:40:22,590 --> 00:40:23,840
Don't.

420
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:34,760
-You're the doctor, aren't you?.
-No.

421
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:36,980
I am a professor.

422
00:40:37,690 --> 00:40:39,520
I don't believe you.

423
00:40:39,690 --> 00:40:41,690
She wants me looked at.

424
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:44,490
They think I'm different.

425
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:46,150
Well, perhaps they're right.

426
00:40:46,330 --> 00:40:47,780
I'm not mad.

427
00:40:47,950 --> 00:40:51,290
Hogwarts is not a place for mad people.

428
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:53,450
Hogwarts is a school.

429
00:40:54,210 --> 00:40:55,370
A school of magic.

430
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:02,630
You can do things, can't you, Tom?.

431
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:06,430
Things other children can't.

432
00:41:07,810 --> 00:41:10,760
I can make things move
without touching them.

433
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:15,270
I can make animals do what I want
without training them.

434
00:41:16,060 --> 00:41:19,600
I can make bad things happen
to people who are mean to me.

435
00:41:20,230 --> 00:41:22,190
I can make them hurt...

436
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:24,360
...if I want.

437
00:41:24,910 --> 00:41:26,780
Who are you?.

438
00:41:26,950 --> 00:41:29,160
Well, I'm like you, Tom.

439
00:41:30,330 --> 00:41:31,790
I'm different.

440
00:41:32,830 --> 00:41:34,240
Prove it.

441
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:45,670
I think there's something in your wardrobe
trying to get out, Tom.

442
00:41:55,390 --> 00:41:59,180
Thievery is not tolerated at Hogwarts,
Tom.

443
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:05,030
At Hogwarts, you'll be taught not only
how to use magic, but how to control it.

444
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:06,360
You understand me?.

445
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:12,860
I can speak to snakes too.

446
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:15,910
They find me.

447
00:42:16,910 --> 00:42:18,820
Whisper things.

448
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:22,200
Is that normal for someone like me?.

449
00:42:43,270 --> 00:42:46,560
Did you know, sir?. Then?.

450
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:52,360
Did I know I'd just met the most
dangerous dark wizard of all time?. No.

451
00:42:52,950 --> 00:42:55,070
If I had, I...

452
00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:59,160
over time, while here at Hogwarts...

453
00:42:59,330 --> 00:43:02,660
...Tom Riddle grew close
to one particular teacher.

454
00:43:02,830 --> 00:43:04,660
Can you guess
who that teacher might be?.

455
00:43:07,590 --> 00:43:11,040
You didn't bring Professor Slughorn back
simply to teach Potions, did you?.

456
00:43:11,220 --> 00:43:13,260
No, I did not.

457
00:43:13,430 --> 00:43:17,260
You see, Professor Slughorn possesses
something I desire very dearly.

458
00:43:18,270 --> 00:43:20,140
And he will not give it up easily.

459
00:43:20,310 --> 00:43:23,510
You said Professor Slughorn
would try to collect me.

460
00:43:23,690 --> 00:43:24,930
I did.

461
00:43:25,650 --> 00:43:27,640
Do you want me to let him?.

462
00:43:29,030 --> 00:43:30,400
Yes.

463
00:44:54,570 --> 00:44:56,280
All right. Um...

464
00:44:56,450 --> 00:44:59,530
This morning, I'm gonna be
putting you all through a few drills...

465
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:01,820
...just to assess your strengths.

466
00:45:02,530 --> 00:45:04,530
Quiet! Please!

467
00:45:04,700 --> 00:45:05,870
Shut it!

468
00:45:09,710 --> 00:45:12,460
Thanks. All right. Um...

469
00:45:12,630 --> 00:45:14,750
Just because you
made the team last year...

470
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:17,880
...does not guarantee you a spot this year.
Is that clear?.

471
00:45:20,390 --> 00:45:21,670
Good.

472
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:32,600
No hard feelings, Weasley, all right?.

473
00:45:33,150 --> 00:45:34,350
Hard feelings?.

474
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:38,060
Yeah, I'll be going out for Keeper as well.
It's nothing personal.

475
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:40,910
Really?. Strapping guy like you?.

476
00:45:41,070 --> 00:45:43,650
You've got more of a Beater's build,
don't you think?.

477
00:45:43,820 --> 00:45:46,230
Keepers need to be quick, agile.

478
00:45:47,620 --> 00:45:49,410
oh, I like my chances.

479
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:53,360
Say, think you could introduce me
to your friend Granger?.

480
00:45:53,540 --> 00:45:57,710
Wouldn't mind getting on
a first-name basis, know what I mean?.

481
00:46:10,020 --> 00:46:11,730
Come on, Weasley!

482
00:46:11,890 --> 00:46:13,600
Come on, Ron!
Go on, Weasley!

483
00:46:15,150 --> 00:46:18,020
Go on, Weasley!
Yeah, Ron!

484
00:46:18,190 --> 00:46:19,440
Go on, Cormac!

485
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:38,040
Come on, Ron!

486
00:46:46,340 --> 00:46:47,970
Come on, Ron.

487
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:50,600
Come on, Ron.

488
00:47:08,490 --> 00:47:09,650
Confundus.

489
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:28,080
Isn't he brilliant?.

490
00:47:30,850 --> 00:47:34,350
I have to admit, I thought
I was gonna miss that last one.

491
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:37,470
I hope Cormac's not taking it too hard.

492
00:47:37,890 --> 00:47:40,930
He's got a bit of a thing for you,
Hermione. Cormac.

493
00:47:42,020 --> 00:47:44,020
He's vile.

494
00:47:48,990 --> 00:47:51,230
Have you ever heard of this spell?.
Sectumsempra?.

495
00:47:51,410 --> 00:47:53,480
No, I haven't.

496
00:47:53,660 --> 00:47:56,780
And if you had a shred of self-respect,
you'd hand that book in.

497
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:59,410
Not bloody likely. He's top of the class.

498
00:47:59,580 --> 00:48:03,750
He's even better than you, Hermione.
Slughorn thinks he's a genius.

499
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:06,160
What?.

500
00:48:07,010 --> 00:48:09,710
I'd like to know whose that book was.
Let's have a look.

501
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:11,380
No.

502
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:14,170
Why not?.

503
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:16,350
The binding is fragile.

504
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:19,140
The binding is fragile?.
-Yeah.

505
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:24,980
-Who's the Half-Blood Prince?.
-Who?.

506
00:48:25,150 --> 00:48:28,900
That's what it says right here: "This book
is property of the Half-Blood Prince. "

507
00:48:46,250 --> 00:48:49,590
HERMloNE: For weeks you carry around
this book, practically sleep with it...

508
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:52,050
... yet you have no desire to find out
who he is?

509
00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:55,630
I didn't say I wasn't curious,
and I don't sleep with it.

510
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:56,840
Well, it's true.

511
00:48:57,010 --> 00:49:00,760
I like a nice chat before I go to bed.
Now all you do is read that bloody book.

512
00:49:00,930 --> 00:49:02,930
It's just like being with Hermione.

513
00:49:04,230 --> 00:49:06,720
Well, I was curious, so I went to-

514
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:09,440
-The library.
-The library. And?.

515
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:11,980
And nothing.

516
00:49:12,150 --> 00:49:15,190
I couldn't find a reference anywhere
to a Half-Blood Prince.

517
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:17,440
-There we go. That settles it, then.
Filius!

518
00:49:17,620 --> 00:49:19,940
I was hoping to find you
in the Three Broomsticks!

519
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:24,780
No, emergency choir practice,
I'm afraid, Horace.

520
00:49:28,290 --> 00:49:30,700
Does anyone fancy a Butterbeer?.

521
00:49:31,050 --> 00:49:33,290
A chum of mine
was sledging down Claxby Hill.

522
00:49:33,470 --> 00:49:37,080
We had a very long, homemade,
Norwegian-style sledge...

523
00:49:37,260 --> 00:49:39,720
No, not there. Over here.

524
00:49:40,350 --> 00:49:41,890
No, sit beside me.

525
00:49:43,640 --> 00:49:44,920
okay.

526
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:47,770
Something to drink?.

527
00:49:47,940 --> 00:49:50,480
HERMloNE: Three Butterbeers,
and some ginger in mine, please.

528
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:04,200
oh, bloody hell.

529
00:50:07,170 --> 00:50:08,990
Slick git.

530
00:50:09,330 --> 00:50:12,000
Honestly, Ronald,
they're only holding hands.

531
00:50:14,840 --> 00:50:16,080
And snogging.

532
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:19,710
-I'd like to leave.
-What?.

533
00:50:19,890 --> 00:50:21,460
You can't be serious.

534
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:24,010
-That happens to be my sister.
-So?.

535
00:50:24,180 --> 00:50:28,100
What if she looked over here and saw you
snogging me?. You expect her to leave?.

536
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:31,850
Hey, my boy!
Hello, sir. Wonderful to see you.

537
00:50:32,020 --> 00:50:34,020
And you, and you.

538
00:50:34,190 --> 00:50:35,980
So, what brings you here?.

539
00:50:36,150 --> 00:50:40,860
The Three Broomsticks and I go way back,
further than I care to admit.

540
00:50:41,030 --> 00:50:44,480
I can remember
when it was One Broomstick.

541
00:50:44,660 --> 00:50:47,990
All hands on deck, Granger.
Listen, my boy, in the old days...

542
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:51,580
...I used to throw together
the occasional supper party...

543
00:50:51,750 --> 00:50:53,960
...for the select student or two.

544
00:50:54,130 --> 00:50:58,000
-Would you be game?.
-I'd consider it an honor, sir.

545
00:50:59,420 --> 00:51:01,630
You would be welcome too, Granger.

546
00:51:02,430 --> 00:51:07,170
-I'd be delighted, sir.
-Splendid. Look for my owl.

547
00:51:08,060 --> 00:51:10,020
Good to see you, Wallenby.

548
00:51:14,940 --> 00:51:16,650
What are you playing at?.

549
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:20,770
Dumbledore's asked me
to get to know him.

550
00:51:20,950 --> 00:51:22,900
-Get to know him?.
-I don't know.

551
00:51:23,070 --> 00:51:26,820
It must be important.
If it wasn't, Dumbledore wouldn't ask.

552
00:51:32,420 --> 00:51:34,540
Got a little bit...

553
00:51:45,430 --> 00:51:47,300
Katie, you don't know what it could be.

554
00:51:47,470 --> 00:51:48,930
Harry.
What?.

555
00:51:49,100 --> 00:51:52,600
Did you hear what she said back
at the pub about me and her snogging?.

556
00:51:53,390 --> 00:51:55,140
As if.

557
00:52:01,570 --> 00:52:04,900
I warned her.
I warned her not to touch it.

558
00:52:26,380 --> 00:52:29,140
Don't get any closer.
Get back, all of you.

559
00:52:41,650 --> 00:52:46,480
Do not touch that, except by
the wrappings. Do you understand?.

560
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:02,530
You're sure Katie did not have this
in her possession...

561
00:53:02,710 --> 00:53:05,200
...when she entered
the Three Broomsticks?.

562
00:53:05,840 --> 00:53:07,380
It's like I said.

563
00:53:07,590 --> 00:53:12,500
She left to go to the loo, and when
she came back she had the package.

564
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:16,470
She said it was important
that she deliver it.

565
00:53:17,310 --> 00:53:20,810
-Did she say to whom?.
-T o Professor Dumbledore.

566
00:53:21,150 --> 00:53:23,820
Very well. Thank you, Leanne.
You may go.

567
00:53:28,530 --> 00:53:34,030
Why is it when something happens
it is always you three?.

568
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:39,530
Believe me, professor, I've been asking
myself the same question for six years.

569
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:41,660
McGONAGALL:
oh, Severus.

570
00:53:47,380 --> 00:53:49,250
What do you think?.

571
00:53:51,180 --> 00:53:55,970
I think Miss Bell is lucky to be alive.

572
00:53:56,140 --> 00:53:58,380
She was cursed, wasn't she?.

573
00:53:58,560 --> 00:54:01,230
I know Katie. off the pitch,
she wouldn't hurt a fly.

574
00:54:01,730 --> 00:54:05,310
If she was delivering that to Dumbledore,
she wasn't doing it knowingly.

575
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:07,390
Yes, she was cursed.

576
00:54:08,190 --> 00:54:09,850
It was Malfoy.

577
00:54:11,780 --> 00:54:15,560
That is a very serious accusation, Potter.

578
00:54:15,740 --> 00:54:17,240
Indeed.

579
00:54:18,080 --> 00:54:21,490
-Your evidence?.
-I just know.

580
00:54:22,250 --> 00:54:24,240
You just...

581
00:54:25,460 --> 00:54:26,870
...know.

582
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:31,830
You astonish with your gifts, Potter.

583
00:54:32,010 --> 00:54:35,960
Gifts mere mortals
can only dream of possessing.

584
00:54:36,140 --> 00:54:42,260
How grand it must be
to be the Chosen one.

585
00:54:46,940 --> 00:54:50,440
I suggest you go back to your dormitories.
All of you.

586
00:55:00,950 --> 00:55:03,870
What do you suppose
Dean sees in her?. Ginny?.

587
00:55:05,580 --> 00:55:07,570
Well, what does she see in him?.

588
00:55:07,750 --> 00:55:09,960
Dean?. He's brilliant.

589
00:55:10,130 --> 00:55:12,960
You called him a slick git
not five hours ago.

590
00:55:13,130 --> 00:55:16,920
Y eah, well, he was running his hands
all over my sister, wasn't he?.

591
00:55:17,090 --> 00:55:21,640
Something snaps, and you've gotta
hate him, you know?. on principle.

592
00:55:22,310 --> 00:55:23,800
I suppose.

593
00:55:25,060 --> 00:55:28,230
-So, what is it he sees in her?.
-I don't know.

594
00:55:28,980 --> 00:55:31,390
She's smart, funny.

595
00:55:32,150 --> 00:55:34,440
-Attractive.
-Attractive?.

596
00:55:35,990 --> 00:55:39,490
-You know, she's got nice skin.
-Skin?.

597
00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:42,150
Dean dates my sister
because of her skin?.

598
00:55:42,330 --> 00:55:46,820
Well, no, I mean, I'm just saying
it could be a contributing factor.

599
00:55:50,210 --> 00:55:51,950
Hermione's got nice skin.

600
00:55:52,670 --> 00:55:55,420
Wouldn't you say?. As skin goes, I mean.

601
00:55:56,380 --> 00:55:58,460
I've never really thought about it.

602
00:56:00,010 --> 00:56:01,720
But, I suppose, yeah.

603
00:56:02,470 --> 00:56:03,930
Very nice.

604
00:56:08,350 --> 00:56:11,720
-I think I'll be going to sleep now.
-Right. Yeah.

605
00:56:21,570 --> 00:56:25,520
So tell me, Cormac, do you see anything
of your Uncle Tiberius these days?.

606
00:56:25,700 --> 00:56:28,190
Yes, sir. In fact,
I'm meant to go hunting with him...

607
00:56:28,370 --> 00:56:30,580
...and the Minister for Magic
over the holidays.

608
00:56:30,750 --> 00:56:33,700
Well, be sure to give them both my best.

609
00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:35,870
What about your uncle, Belby?.

610
00:56:36,050 --> 00:56:39,500
For those who don't know, Marcus'
uncle invented the Wolfsbane Potion.

611
00:56:39,670 --> 00:56:42,460
-Is he working on anything new?.
-Don't know.

612
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:46,720
Him and Dad don't get on. Probably
because me dad says potions are rubbish.

613
00:56:46,890 --> 00:56:50,170
Says the only potion worth having
is a stiff one at the end of the day.

614
00:56:50,350 --> 00:56:55,480
What about you, Miss Granger?. What does
your family do in the Muggle world?.

615
00:56:56,230 --> 00:56:58,060
My parents are dentists.

616
00:57:02,610 --> 00:57:03,890
They tend to people's teeth.

617
00:57:04,070 --> 00:57:08,820
Fascinating. And is that considered
a dangerous profession?.

618
00:57:08,990 --> 00:57:10,270
No.

619
00:57:12,250 --> 00:57:16,740
AIthough, one boy, Robbie Fenwick,
did bite my father once.

620
00:57:16,920 --> 00:57:18,160
He needed 10 stitches.

621
00:57:24,430 --> 00:57:28,040
Ah. Miss Weasley. Come in, come in.

622
00:57:30,770 --> 00:57:35,180
Look at her eyes.
They've been fighting again, her and Dean.

623
00:57:35,350 --> 00:57:38,060
Sorry. I'm not usually late.

624
00:57:41,860 --> 00:57:46,270
No matter. You're just in time for dessert,
that is, if Belby's left you any.

625
00:57:54,210 --> 00:57:55,280
What?.

626
00:57:55,460 --> 00:57:57,080
Nothing.

627
00:58:03,420 --> 00:58:07,040
Goodbye. Bye-bye.

628
00:58:11,930 --> 00:58:13,670
-Potter.
-I'm sorry, sir.

629
00:58:13,850 --> 00:58:16,420
I was just admiring your hourglass.

630
00:58:17,810 --> 00:58:19,270
oh, yes.

631
00:58:19,810 --> 00:58:21,850
A most intriguing object.

632
00:58:22,520 --> 00:58:26,770
The sand runs in accordance
with the quality of the conversation.

633
00:58:27,070 --> 00:58:30,320
If it is stimulating, the sand runs slowly.

634
00:58:30,820 --> 00:58:32,730
-If it is not...
-I think I'll be going.

635
00:58:32,910 --> 00:58:36,240
Nonsense.
You have nothing to fear, dear boy.

636
00:58:36,410 --> 00:58:38,650
As to some of your classmates...

637
00:58:38,830 --> 00:58:42,250
...well, let's just say they're unlikely
to make the shelf.

638
00:58:42,420 --> 00:58:43,910
The shelf, sir?.

639
00:58:44,500 --> 00:58:48,120
Anyone who aspires to be anyone
hopes to end up here.

640
00:58:48,300 --> 00:58:52,170
But then again, you already are someone,
aren't you, Harry?.

641
00:58:53,720 --> 00:58:55,680
Did Voldemort ever make the shelf, sir?.

642
00:58:57,850 --> 00:59:01,760
You knew him, didn't you, sir,
T om Riddle?. You were his teacher.

643
00:59:02,860 --> 00:59:06,350
Mr. Riddle had a number of teachers
whilst here at Hogwarts.

644
00:59:06,530 --> 00:59:08,100
What was he like?.

645
00:59:11,820 --> 00:59:14,190
I'm sorry, sir. Forgive me.

646
00:59:14,870 --> 00:59:16,690
He killed my parents.

647
00:59:19,460 --> 00:59:20,740
of course.

648
00:59:21,120 --> 00:59:24,120
It's only natural
you should want to know more.

649
00:59:26,210 --> 00:59:29,050
But I'm afraid I must disappoint you,
Harry.

650
00:59:29,970 --> 00:59:32,210
When I first met Mr. Riddle,
he was a quiet...

651
00:59:32,380 --> 00:59:36,630
...albeit brilliant, boy committed
to becoming a first-rate wizard.

652
00:59:36,810 --> 00:59:38,550
Not unlike others I've known.

653
00:59:39,140 --> 00:59:41,220
Not unlike yourself, in fact.

654
00:59:42,560 --> 00:59:44,640
If the monster existed...

655
00:59:45,190 --> 00:59:47,430
...it was buried deep within.

656
01:00:04,750 --> 01:00:06,240
Good luck, eh, Ron.

657
01:00:07,670 --> 01:00:10,120
Nice hat!
Ron, you're a loser.

658
01:00:10,300 --> 01:00:13,380
I'm counting on you, Ron.
I have two Galleons on Gryffindor, yeah?.

659
01:00:13,550 --> 01:00:15,870
Looking good, Ron.
Loser!

660
01:00:18,100 --> 01:00:19,590
What's he wearing?.

661
01:00:28,230 --> 01:00:30,060
So how was it, then?.

662
01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:33,600
-How was what?.
-Your dinner party?.

663
01:00:33,780 --> 01:00:35,400
HERMloNE:
Pretty boring, actually.

664
01:00:36,200 --> 01:00:38,520
Though I think Harry enjoyed dessert.

665
01:00:41,950 --> 01:00:44,700
Slughorn's having a Christmas do,
you know.

666
01:00:44,870 --> 01:00:46,410
And we're meant to bring someone.

667
01:00:46,580 --> 01:00:50,280
I expect you'll be bringing McLaggen.
He's in the Slug Club, isn't he?.

668
01:00:50,460 --> 01:00:53,300
-Actually, I was going to ask you.
Really?.

669
01:00:56,130 --> 01:00:58,130
Good luck today, Ron.

670
01:00:58,970 --> 01:01:01,290
I know you'll be brilliant.

671
01:01:04,350 --> 01:01:08,100
I'm resigning. After today's match,
McLaggen can have my spot.

672
01:01:08,270 --> 01:01:09,760
Have it your way.

673
01:01:09,940 --> 01:01:12,430
-Juice?.
-Sure.

674
01:01:12,610 --> 01:01:14,320
Hello, everyone.

675
01:01:15,570 --> 01:01:17,640
You look dreadful, Ron.

676
01:01:17,820 --> 01:01:20,190
Is that why you put something
in his cup?.

677
01:01:22,410 --> 01:01:24,030
Is it a tonic?.

678
01:01:27,500 --> 01:01:29,120
Liquid luck.

679
01:01:30,500 --> 01:01:32,160
Don't drink it, Ron.

680
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:43,130
-You could be expelled for that.
-I don't know what you're talking about.

681
01:01:45,350 --> 01:01:47,970
Come on, Harry.
We've got a game to win.

682
01:02:11,790 --> 01:02:13,700
Yes!

683
01:02:14,130 --> 01:02:16,960
Go on, Ron! Do it!

684
01:02:50,910 --> 01:02:53,200
Weasley! Weasley! Weasley!

685
01:02:53,660 --> 01:02:55,040
Yes!

686
01:02:55,210 --> 01:02:58,660
Weasley! Weasley! Weasley!

687
01:03:02,460 --> 01:03:04,040
Whoo!

688
01:03:04,220 --> 01:03:07,420
Yes. Whoo!

689
01:03:08,970 --> 01:03:14,010
Weasley! Weasley! Weasley!

690
01:03:18,270 --> 01:03:19,980
You really shouldn't have done it.

691
01:03:20,150 --> 01:03:25,140
I know. I suppose I could've
just used a Confundus Charm.

692
01:03:26,150 --> 01:03:30,780
That was different. That was tryouts.
This was an actual game.

693
01:03:33,580 --> 01:03:35,290
You didn't put it in.

694
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:38,830
Ron only thought you did.

695
01:04:26,630 --> 01:04:29,920
Charms spell. I'm just practicing.

696
01:04:33,850 --> 01:04:35,670
Well, they're really good.

697
01:04:41,190 --> 01:04:43,180
How does it feel, Harry?.

698
01:04:46,020 --> 01:04:49,230
When you see Dean with Ginny?.

699
01:04:54,320 --> 01:04:55,780
I know.

700
01:04:56,870 --> 01:04:59,030
I see the way you look at her.

701
01:04:59,750 --> 01:05:01,370
You're my best friend.

702
01:05:10,460 --> 01:05:12,290
oops.

703
01:05:13,720 --> 01:05:15,960
I think this room's taken.

704
01:05:17,720 --> 01:05:19,130
What's with the birds?.

705
01:05:22,520 --> 01:05:24,230
Oppugno.

706
01:05:52,260 --> 01:05:53,960
It feels like this.

707
01:06:33,670 --> 01:06:36,710
Look, I can't help it
if she's got her knickers in a twist.

708
01:06:36,880 --> 01:06:41,960
What Lav and I have, well,
let's just say, there's no stopping it.

709
01:06:42,140 --> 01:06:43,550
It's chemical.

710
01:06:43,720 --> 01:06:48,050
Will it last?. Who knows?.
Point is, I'm a free agent.

711
01:06:48,230 --> 01:06:51,060
He's at perfect liberty
to kiss whoever he likes.

712
01:06:51,230 --> 01:06:53,640
I really couldn't care less.

713
01:06:53,820 --> 01:06:57,650
Was I under the impression he and I would
be attending Slughorn's Christmas party?.

714
01:06:57,820 --> 01:06:59,310
Yes.

715
01:06:59,490 --> 01:07:03,900
Now, given the circumstances,
I've had to make other arrangements.

716
01:07:04,080 --> 01:07:05,270
Have you?.

717
01:07:05,450 --> 01:07:07,440
Yes. Why?.

718
01:07:07,620 --> 01:07:11,240
I just thought, seeing as neither of us
can go with who we'd really like to...

719
01:07:11,420 --> 01:07:13,660
...we should go together, as friends.

720
01:07:13,840 --> 01:07:15,460
Why didn't I think of that?.

721
01:07:15,630 --> 01:07:17,170
Who are you going with?.

722
01:07:17,340 --> 01:07:19,130
Um, it's a surprise.

723
01:07:19,300 --> 01:07:23,510
Anyway, it's you we've got to worry
about. You can't just take anyone.

724
01:07:24,140 --> 01:07:26,010
See that girl over there?.

725
01:07:27,640 --> 01:07:32,350
That's Romilda Vane. Apparently she's
trying to smuggle you a love potion.

726
01:07:32,520 --> 01:07:34,010
Really?.

727
01:07:34,980 --> 01:07:38,430
Hey! She's only interested in you because
she thinks you're the Chosen one.

728
01:07:38,610 --> 01:07:40,320
But I am the Chosen One.

729
01:07:40,490 --> 01:07:43,360
okay, sorry. Um, kidding.

730
01:07:45,370 --> 01:07:46,820
I'll ask someone I like.

731
01:07:47,620 --> 01:07:49,160
Someone cool.

732
01:07:58,920 --> 01:08:01,960
I've never been to this part of the castle.

733
01:08:02,130 --> 01:08:05,380
At least not while awake.
I sleepwalk, you see.

734
01:08:05,550 --> 01:08:08,040
That's why I wear shoes to bed.

735
01:08:39,250 --> 01:08:42,250
Harmonia Nectere Passus.

736
01:08:54,770 --> 01:08:57,520
Harmonia Nectere Passus.

737
01:08:59,060 --> 01:09:01,730
Harmonia Nectere Passus.

738
01:09:16,370 --> 01:09:17,780
Drink?.

739
01:09:18,710 --> 01:09:20,040
Neville.

740
01:09:20,210 --> 01:09:21,670
I didn't get into the Slug Club.

741
01:09:21,840 --> 01:09:24,960
It's okay, though. He's got Belby
handing out towels in the loo.

742
01:09:25,130 --> 01:09:27,920
-oh, well, I'm fine, mate. Thanks.
-okay.

743
01:09:38,350 --> 01:09:41,310
Hermione. What are you doing?.
And what happened to you?.

744
01:09:41,480 --> 01:09:46,770
I've just escaped.
I mean, left Cormac under the mistletoe.

745
01:09:46,940 --> 01:09:49,980
Cormac?. That's who you invited?.

746
01:09:50,150 --> 01:09:52,650
I thought it would annoy Ron the most.

747
01:09:53,490 --> 01:09:55,480
Thank you. I'll catch up with you later.

748
01:09:55,660 --> 01:09:58,660
He's got more tentacles
than a Snarfalump plant.

749
01:09:58,830 --> 01:10:00,990
-Dragon tartare?.
-No, I'm fine. Thank you.

750
01:10:01,170 --> 01:10:03,830
Just as well.
They give one horribly bad breath.

751
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:05,830
on second thoughts...

752
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
Might keep Cormac at bay.

753
01:10:08,340 --> 01:10:11,260
oh, God, here he comes.

754
01:10:13,800 --> 01:10:16,670
I think she just went to powder her nose.

755
01:10:16,850 --> 01:10:18,920
Slippery little minx, your friend.

756
01:10:19,100 --> 01:10:21,800
Likes to work her mouth too,
doesn't she?.

757
01:10:24,860 --> 01:10:26,850
What is this I'm eating, by the way?.

758
01:10:28,020 --> 01:10:29,650
Dragon balls.

759
01:10:40,870 --> 01:10:43,990
You've just bought yourself
a month's detention, McLaggen.

760
01:10:44,170 --> 01:10:48,030
Not so quick, Potter.

761
01:10:49,590 --> 01:10:52,710
Sir, I really think I should
rejoin the party. My date...

762
01:10:52,880 --> 01:10:56,800
Can surely survive your absence
for another minute or two.

763
01:10:56,970 --> 01:10:59,210
Besides, I only wish
to convey a message.

764
01:10:59,850 --> 01:11:02,090
-A message?.
-From Professor Dumbledore.

765
01:11:02,270 --> 01:11:05,930
He asked me to give you his best,
and he hopes you enjoy your holiday.

766
01:11:06,100 --> 01:11:07,650
You see...

767
01:11:07,810 --> 01:11:13,350
...he's traveling, and he won't
return until term resumes.

768
01:11:13,530 --> 01:11:15,070
Traveling where?.

769
01:11:23,200 --> 01:11:25,080
T ake your hands off me, you filthy Squib!

770
01:11:26,210 --> 01:11:27,910
Professor Slughorn, sir.

771
01:11:28,080 --> 01:11:32,410
I just discovered this boy
lurking in an upstairs corridor.

772
01:11:32,590 --> 01:11:34,630
He claims to have been
invited to your party.

773
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:38,080
okay, okay. I was gatecrashing. Happy?.

774
01:11:38,260 --> 01:11:42,090
I'll escort him out.

775
01:11:44,890 --> 01:11:48,560
Certainly, professor.

776
01:11:52,190 --> 01:11:55,440
All right, everyone, carry on, carry on.

777
01:11:57,530 --> 01:12:02,440
DRACo: Maybe I did hex that Bell girl.
Maybe I didn't. What's it to you?.

778
01:12:02,620 --> 01:12:04,690
I swore to protect you.

779
01:12:04,870 --> 01:12:08,200
I made the Unbreakable Vow.

780
01:12:08,370 --> 01:12:10,530
I don't need protection.

781
01:12:10,710 --> 01:12:14,870
I was chosen for this.
out of all others. Me.

782
01:12:15,800 --> 01:12:19,330
-And I won't fail him.
-You're afraid, Draco.

783
01:12:19,930 --> 01:12:23,840
You attempt to conceal it,
but it's obvious. Let me assist you.

784
01:12:24,010 --> 01:12:25,470
No!

785
01:12:25,810 --> 01:12:29,220
I was chosen. This is my moment.

786
01:12:41,660 --> 01:12:43,230
"Unbreakable Vow. "

787
01:12:43,410 --> 01:12:45,030
You're sure that's what Snape said?.

788
01:12:45,200 --> 01:12:47,490
Positive. Why?.

789
01:12:47,660 --> 01:12:51,160
Well, it's just you can't break
an Unbreakable Vow.

790
01:12:51,330 --> 01:12:54,670
I'd worked that much out for myself,
funnily enough.

791
01:12:55,170 --> 01:12:56,910
You don't understand.

792
01:12:57,550 --> 01:12:58,580
oh, bloody hell.

793
01:13:26,410 --> 01:13:28,360
I miss you.

794
01:13:30,080 --> 01:13:31,620
Lovely.

795
01:13:31,790 --> 01:13:35,070
All she wants to do is snog me.
My lips are getting chapped. Look.

796
01:13:35,250 --> 01:13:37,460
I'll take your word for it.

797
01:13:47,550 --> 01:13:52,510
So, what happens to you?. What happens
if you break an Unbreakable Vow?.

798
01:13:53,060 --> 01:13:54,770
You die.

799
01:13:59,360 --> 01:14:01,230
Wait, the pudding's still here.

800
01:14:02,480 --> 01:14:05,820
Voldemort has chosen
Draco Malfoy for a mission?.

801
01:14:05,990 --> 01:14:07,070
I know it sounds mad.

802
01:14:07,240 --> 01:14:10,740
Has it occurred to you Snape was
simply pretending to offer Draco help...

803
01:14:10,910 --> 01:14:13,400
...so he could find out
what he was up to?.

804
01:14:13,580 --> 01:14:16,580
-That's not what it sounded like.
Perhaps Harry's right.

805
01:14:17,120 --> 01:14:18,750
T o make an Unbreakable Vow, it's-

806
01:14:18,920 --> 01:14:22,420
It comes down to whether or not
you trust Dumbledore's judgment.

807
01:14:22,590 --> 01:14:26,670
-Dumbledore trusts Snape, therefore I do.
-Dumbledore can make mistakes.

808
01:14:26,840 --> 01:14:28,000
You're blinded by hatred.

809
01:14:28,180 --> 01:14:30,220
-I'm not.
-Yes, you are.

810
01:14:31,970 --> 01:14:34,970
People are disappearing, Harry, daily.

811
01:14:35,140 --> 01:14:37,100
We place our trust
in a handful of people.

812
01:14:37,270 --> 01:14:40,220
If we start fighting amongst ourselves,
we're doomed.

813
01:15:04,710 --> 01:15:06,250
open up, you.

814
01:15:07,920 --> 01:15:09,550
Don't you trust me?.

815
01:15:15,810 --> 01:15:16,890
It's good.

816
01:15:17,810 --> 01:15:20,640
Yeah, I'll just- Get- Yeah.

817
01:15:27,400 --> 01:15:30,190
-Pie?.
-Not for me, no.

818
01:15:42,120 --> 01:15:43,670
You'll have to forgive Remus.

819
01:15:43,920 --> 01:15:46,750
It takes its toll, his condition.

820
01:15:47,670 --> 01:15:49,710
Are you all right, Mr. Weasley?.

821
01:15:49,880 --> 01:15:52,420
We're being followed, all of us.

822
01:15:52,590 --> 01:15:55,080
Most days,
Molly doesn't leave the house.

823
01:15:55,930 --> 01:15:58,000
It's not been easy.

824
01:16:00,020 --> 01:16:01,430
Did you get my owl?.

825
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:03,680
Yes, I did.

826
01:16:05,190 --> 01:16:08,220
If Dumbledore's traveling,
then that's news to the Ministry...

827
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:10,850
...but perhaps that's the way
Dumbledore wants it.

828
01:16:11,570 --> 01:16:14,060
As for Draco Malfoy...

829
01:16:14,700 --> 01:16:15,860
...I know a bit more.

830
01:16:16,490 --> 01:16:19,530
-Go on.
-I sent an agent to Borgin and Burkes.

831
01:16:19,700 --> 01:16:22,030
I think, from what you described...

832
01:16:22,200 --> 01:16:23,860
...what you and Ron saw in summer...

833
01:16:24,040 --> 01:16:27,540
...the object
that Draco is so interested in...

834
01:16:27,710 --> 01:16:29,200
...is a vanishing cabinet.

835
01:16:30,090 --> 01:16:31,370
A vanishing cabinet?.

836
01:16:31,550 --> 01:16:35,540
They were all the rage
when Voldemort first rose to power.

837
01:16:35,720 --> 01:16:38,670
You can see the appeal.
Should Death Eaters come knocking...

838
01:16:38,850 --> 01:16:43,590
...one simply had to slip inside
and disappear for an hour or two.

839
01:16:44,230 --> 01:16:45,970
They can transport you anywhere.

840
01:16:46,140 --> 01:16:49,510
Tricky contraptions though,
very temperamental.

841
01:16:49,690 --> 01:16:52,610
What happened to it?.
The one at Borgin and Burkes?.

842
01:16:52,780 --> 01:16:53,890
Nothing.

843
01:16:54,740 --> 01:16:56,440
It's still there.

844
01:17:07,540 --> 01:17:09,250
It was delicious, Molly, really.

845
01:17:09,420 --> 01:17:10,750
Are you sure you won't stay?.

846
01:17:10,920 --> 01:17:15,300
No, we should go. The first night
of the cycle's always the worst.

847
01:17:15,460 --> 01:17:16,500
Remus?.

848
01:17:25,430 --> 01:17:26,970
Sweetheart.

849
01:17:35,280 --> 01:17:37,020
Has Ron gone to bed?.

850
01:17:37,190 --> 01:17:40,030
Um... Not yet. No.

851
01:17:41,820 --> 01:17:43,150
Shoelace.

852
01:17:55,750 --> 01:17:57,630
Merry Christmas, Harry.

853
01:17:59,050 --> 01:18:00,590
Merry Christmas.

854
01:18:17,860 --> 01:18:20,150
-Harry, no!
-Remus!

855
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:31,410
Ginny!

856
01:18:34,580 --> 01:18:39,250
I killed Sirius Black!
I killed Sirius Black!

857
01:18:39,420 --> 01:18:41,660
You coming to get me?.

858
01:18:42,760 --> 01:18:46,090
Harry, can you get me?.
You coming to get me?.

859
01:19:15,830 --> 01:19:17,210
Harry?.

860
01:19:34,730 --> 01:19:36,390
Stupefy!

861
01:19:59,250 --> 01:20:00,990
Harry!

862
01:20:14,510 --> 01:20:15,710
Ginny!

863
01:20:45,290 --> 01:20:46,790
Molly.

864
01:21:09,780 --> 01:21:11,480
HERMloNE:
It's easy for them to get to you.

865
01:21:11,650 --> 01:21:15,780
You're bloody lucky you weren't killed.
You have to realize who you are, Harry.

866
01:21:15,950 --> 01:21:18,490
I know who I am, Hermione, all right?.

867
01:21:19,450 --> 01:21:20,650
Sorry.

868
01:21:22,330 --> 01:21:25,660
Lav, come on. Of course I'll wear it.

869
01:21:25,830 --> 01:21:27,990
That's my Won-Won.

870
01:21:30,010 --> 01:21:32,410
Excuse me, I have to go and vomit.

871
01:21:50,070 --> 01:21:52,360
I'd like to know
where you get your information.

872
01:21:52,530 --> 01:21:55,560
More knowledgeable
than half the staff, you are.

873
01:22:01,200 --> 01:22:02,740
Sir...

874
01:22:03,200 --> 01:22:06,040
...is it true
that Professor Merrythought is retiring?.

875
01:22:06,210 --> 01:22:08,990
Now, T om.
I couldn't tell you if I knew, could I?.

876
01:22:09,250 --> 01:22:13,420
By the way, thank you for the pineapple.
You're quite right, it is my favorite.

877
01:22:14,010 --> 01:22:16,300
But how did you know?.

878
01:22:18,140 --> 01:22:19,710
Intuition.

879
01:22:23,890 --> 01:22:25,600
Gracious. Is it that time already?.

880
01:22:25,770 --> 01:22:29,430
off you go, boys, or Professor Dippet
will have us all in detention.

881
01:22:33,570 --> 01:22:37,400
Look sharp, Tom. Don't want to be caught
out of bed after hours.

882
01:22:39,320 --> 01:22:41,400
-Is something on your mind, T om?.
-Yes, sir.

883
01:22:42,740 --> 01:22:45,580
You see, I couldn't think
of anyone else to go to.

884
01:22:46,500 --> 01:22:51,490
The other professors,
well, they're not like you.

885
01:22:51,880 --> 01:22:54,910
They might misunderstand.

886
01:22:55,090 --> 01:22:56,670
Go on.

887
01:22:57,470 --> 01:22:59,750
I was in the library the other night...

888
01:23:00,300 --> 01:23:02,510
...in the Restricted Section...

889
01:23:03,260 --> 01:23:06,800
...and I read something rather odd
about a bit of rare magic.

890
01:23:07,730 --> 01:23:11,220
And I thought perhaps
you could illuminate me.

891
01:23:11,400 --> 01:23:14,180
It's called, as I understand it...

892
01:23:17,110 --> 01:23:18,270
I beg your pardon?.

893
01:23:18,440 --> 01:23:22,030
I don't know anything about such things,
and if I did, I wouldn't tell you!

894
01:23:22,200 --> 01:23:26,990
Now, get out of here at once, and don't
let me ever catch you mentioning it again!

895
01:23:29,960 --> 01:23:31,120
Confused?.

896
01:23:31,790 --> 01:23:33,280
I'd be surprised if you weren't.

897
01:23:34,210 --> 01:23:36,960
Well, I don't understand.
What happened?.

898
01:23:37,130 --> 01:23:40,790
This is perhaps the most important
memory I've collected.

899
01:23:41,130 --> 01:23:42,880
It is also a lie.

900
01:23:43,800 --> 01:23:45,590
This memory has been tampered with...

901
01:23:45,760 --> 01:23:50,140
...by the same person whose memory it is,
our old friend, Professor Slughorn.

902
01:23:50,770 --> 01:23:52,760
But why would he tamper
with his own memory?.

903
01:23:52,940 --> 01:23:55,810
-I suspect he's ashamed of it.
-Why?.

904
01:23:55,980 --> 01:23:57,480
Why, indeed?.

905
01:23:58,270 --> 01:24:01,640
I asked you to get to know
Professor Slughorn, and you have done so.

906
01:24:01,820 --> 01:24:05,440
Now I want you to persuade him
to divulge his true memory...

907
01:24:05,620 --> 01:24:07,160
...any way you can.

908
01:24:07,330 --> 01:24:09,280
I don't know him that well, sir.

909
01:24:13,750 --> 01:24:16,670
This memory is everything.

910
01:24:17,170 --> 01:24:19,160
Without it, we are blind.

911
01:24:19,670 --> 01:24:23,290
Without it, we leave the fate
of our world to chance.

912
01:24:25,340 --> 01:24:27,170
You have no choice.

913
01:24:28,390 --> 01:24:30,380
You must not fail.

914
01:24:38,480 --> 01:24:40,810
So I'd highly recommend
you reacquaint yourself...

915
01:24:40,980 --> 01:24:42,440
...with the chapter on antidotes.

916
01:24:42,610 --> 01:24:46,360
I'll tell you more about bezoars
in our next class. Right, off you go.

917
01:24:46,530 --> 01:24:49,020
Alys, don't forget your rat tail.

918
01:24:54,500 --> 01:24:58,280
Aha. If it isn't
the Prince of Potions himself.

919
01:24:58,460 --> 01:25:00,370
To what do I owe this pleasure?.

920
01:25:01,550 --> 01:25:03,620
Sir, I wondered
if I might ask you something.

921
01:25:03,800 --> 01:25:06,040
Ask away, dear boy, ask away.

922
01:25:06,220 --> 01:25:09,220
The other day I was in the library,
in the Restricted Section...

923
01:25:09,390 --> 01:25:13,050
...and I came across something rather odd
about a very rare piece of magic.

924
01:25:14,390 --> 01:25:17,060
Yes. And what was this
rare piece of magic?.

925
01:25:17,230 --> 01:25:20,560
Well, I don't know.
I can't remember the name exactly.

926
01:25:20,730 --> 01:25:25,060
It got me wondering, are there some kinds
of magic you're not allowed to teach us?.

927
01:25:27,070 --> 01:25:28,400
I'm Potions Master, Harry.

928
01:25:28,570 --> 01:25:31,410
I think your question'd
better be posed to Professor Snape.

929
01:25:31,570 --> 01:25:33,480
Yes. Um...

930
01:25:33,660 --> 01:25:36,150
He and I don't exactly
see eye to eye, sir.

931
01:25:36,330 --> 01:25:38,120
What I mean to say is...

932
01:25:38,960 --> 01:25:40,750
...well, he's not like you.

933
01:25:41,420 --> 01:25:43,240
He might misunderstand.

934
01:25:44,550 --> 01:25:48,380
Yes. There can be no light
without the dark.

935
01:25:48,550 --> 01:25:52,590
And so it is with magic. Myself, I always
strive to live within the light.

936
01:25:53,220 --> 01:25:54,880
I suggest you do the same.

937
01:25:55,260 --> 01:25:58,270
Is that what you told Tom Riddle,
when he came asking questions?.

938
01:26:05,230 --> 01:26:08,270
Dumbledore put you up to this,
didn't he?.

939
01:26:10,280 --> 01:26:11,900
Didn't he?.

940
01:26:19,290 --> 01:26:20,570
Yes?.

941
01:26:20,960 --> 01:26:23,080
oh, it's you, Potter.

942
01:26:23,250 --> 01:26:25,620
I'm sorry, I'm busy at the moment.

943
01:26:38,430 --> 01:26:42,220
It's beautiful, isn't it?. The moon.

944
01:26:43,230 --> 01:26:44,640
Divine.

945
01:26:45,310 --> 01:26:47,600
Had ourselves a little
late-night snack, did we?.

946
01:26:48,730 --> 01:26:52,320
It was on your bed, the box.
I just thought I'd try one.

947
01:26:52,490 --> 01:26:55,990
Or 20.
-I can't stop thinking about her, Harry.

948
01:26:56,160 --> 01:26:58,150
Honestly, I reckoned
she was annoying you.

949
01:26:58,330 --> 01:27:00,650
She could never annoy me.

950
01:27:02,450 --> 01:27:04,000
I think I love her.

951
01:27:07,580 --> 01:27:09,870
Well, brilliant.

952
01:27:13,720 --> 01:27:15,340
Do you think she knows I exist?.

953
01:27:15,510 --> 01:27:18,000
I hope so. She's been snogging you
for three months.

954
01:27:18,180 --> 01:27:21,130
Snogging?. Who are you talking about?.

955
01:27:22,060 --> 01:27:23,300
Who are you talking about?.

956
01:27:24,060 --> 01:27:27,680
Romilda, of course. Romilda Vane.

957
01:27:27,850 --> 01:27:29,350
okay, very funny.

958
01:27:32,480 --> 01:27:36,150
-What was that for?.
-It's no joke! I'm in love with her!

959
01:27:36,320 --> 01:27:39,190
Fine, you're in love with her.
Have you ever actually met her?.

960
01:27:40,160 --> 01:27:43,110
No. Can you introduce me?.

961
01:28:04,810 --> 01:28:09,550
Come on, Ron. I'm gonna introduce you
to Romilda Vane.

962
01:28:20,320 --> 01:28:24,020
I'm sorry, sir. I wouldn't bother you
if it weren't absolutely essential.

963
01:28:24,870 --> 01:28:26,280
Where's Romilda?.

964
01:28:26,450 --> 01:28:28,410
What's the matter with Wenby?.

965
01:28:28,910 --> 01:28:30,740
Very powerful love potion.

966
01:28:30,920 --> 01:28:33,290
Very well. Better bring him in.

967
01:28:33,460 --> 01:28:36,750
I'd have thought you could whip up
a remedy for this in no time, Harry.

968
01:28:36,920 --> 01:28:39,840
Well, I thought this called
for a more practiced hand, sir.

969
01:28:40,010 --> 01:28:43,090
Hello, darling. Fancy a drink?.

970
01:28:43,260 --> 01:28:44,920
Perhaps you're right.

971
01:28:49,430 --> 01:28:54,860
I'm sorry, by the way, professor,
about earlier today, our misunderstanding.

972
01:28:55,020 --> 01:28:59,400
oh, not at all. All water
under the bridge, you know?. Correct?.

973
01:28:59,570 --> 01:29:02,490
I expect you' re tired of it
after all these years.

974
01:29:02,660 --> 01:29:05,230
All the questions about Voldemort.

975
01:29:05,410 --> 01:29:07,240
Don't use that name.

976
01:29:14,960 --> 01:29:17,040
There you are, old boy. Bottoms up.

977
01:29:17,210 --> 01:29:20,330
-What's this?.
Tonic for the nerves.

978
01:29:34,850 --> 01:29:37,140
-What happened to me?.
-Love potion.

979
01:29:37,310 --> 01:29:39,440
A bloody strong one at that.

980
01:29:40,030 --> 01:29:43,640
-I feel really bad.
You need a pick-me-up.

981
01:29:43,820 --> 01:29:47,490
Got Butterbeer,
wine, dazzling oak-matured mead.

982
01:29:47,660 --> 01:29:51,990
I had other intentions for this,
but I think, given the circumstances...

983
01:29:54,290 --> 01:29:56,000
Here we are, Potter.

984
01:29:56,170 --> 01:29:57,660
T o life!

985
01:30:02,460 --> 01:30:03,500
Ron.

986
01:30:05,970 --> 01:30:09,420
Ron. Professor, do something.

987
01:30:10,510 --> 01:30:12,140
I don't understand.

988
01:30:28,530 --> 01:30:30,320
Come on, Ron, breathe.

989
01:30:52,550 --> 01:30:55,390
These girls, they're gonna kill me.

990
01:31:06,400 --> 01:31:09,770
Quick thinking on your part, Harry,
using a bezoar.

991
01:31:09,950 --> 01:31:12,320
You must be very proud
of your student, Horace.

992
01:31:12,490 --> 01:31:15,910
Hm?. oh, yes, very proud.

993
01:31:16,080 --> 01:31:18,830
I think we agree,
Potter's actions were heroic.

994
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:22,990
The question is,
why were they necessary?.

995
01:31:23,170 --> 01:31:24,910
Why, indeed?.

996
01:31:25,090 --> 01:31:27,080
This appears to be a gift, Horace.

997
01:31:27,420 --> 01:31:30,260
You don't remember
who gave you this bottle?.

998
01:31:30,430 --> 01:31:34,370
Which, by the way, possesses remarkably
subtle hints of licorice and cherry...

999
01:31:34,550 --> 01:31:37,010
...when not polluted with poison.

1000
01:31:37,180 --> 01:31:40,300
Actually I had intended
to give it as a gift myself.

1001
01:31:40,480 --> 01:31:41,850
T o whom, I might ask?.

1002
01:31:43,690 --> 01:31:45,850
T o you, Headmaster.

1003
01:31:48,190 --> 01:31:49,270
Where is he?.

1004
01:31:49,440 --> 01:31:53,570
Where's my Won-Won?.
Has he been asking for me?.

1005
01:31:56,620 --> 01:31:58,280
What's she doing here?.

1006
01:31:58,450 --> 01:32:00,690
I might ask you the same question.

1007
01:32:00,870 --> 01:32:03,110
I happen to be his girlfriend.

1008
01:32:03,290 --> 01:32:06,040
I happen to be his friend.

1009
01:32:06,210 --> 01:32:10,420
Don't make me laugh.
You haven't spoken in weeks.

1010
01:32:11,210 --> 01:32:14,090
I suppose you want to make up
now that he's all interesting.

1011
01:32:14,260 --> 01:32:17,960
He's been poisoned, you daft dimbo!

1012
01:32:18,140 --> 01:32:20,970
And for the record,
I've always found him interesting.

1013
01:32:22,640 --> 01:32:27,680
Ah. See?. He senses my presence.

1014
01:32:27,860 --> 01:32:31,140
Don't worry, Won-Won. I'm here.

1015
01:32:31,820 --> 01:32:33,650
I'm here.

1016
01:32:39,490 --> 01:32:42,700
Uh... Hermione...

1017
01:32:46,750 --> 01:32:48,740
Hermione.

1018
01:32:49,500 --> 01:32:51,740
Hermione.

1019
01:32:59,350 --> 01:33:03,260
oh, to be young,
and to feel love's keen sting.

1020
01:33:03,600 --> 01:33:05,920
Well, come away, everybody.

1021
01:33:06,100 --> 01:33:08,720
Mr. Weasley is well tended.

1022
01:33:12,980 --> 01:33:15,520
About time, don't you think?.

1023
01:33:18,200 --> 01:33:19,770
Thank you.

1024
01:33:22,700 --> 01:33:24,530
oh, shut up.

1025
01:35:36,830 --> 01:35:40,620
Stop it, Ron. You're making it snow.

1026
01:35:45,090 --> 01:35:47,760
Tell me how I broke up
with Lavender again.

1027
01:35:48,590 --> 01:35:51,430
Um, well...

1028
01:35:51,600 --> 01:35:54,600
...she came to visit you
in the hospital.

1029
01:35:55,480 --> 01:35:57,880
And you talked.

1030
01:35:59,480 --> 01:36:03,560
I don't believe it was
a particularly long conversation.

1031
01:36:03,730 --> 01:36:07,020
Don't get me wrong, I'm bloody thrilled
to be shot of her.

1032
01:36:07,200 --> 01:36:09,520
It's just she seems a bit put out.

1033
01:36:16,040 --> 01:36:19,540
Yes, she does, doesn't she?.

1034
01:36:21,170 --> 01:36:26,210
You say you don't remember
anything from that night?.

1035
01:36:26,380 --> 01:36:29,380
Anything at all?.

1036
01:36:29,550 --> 01:36:31,380
There is something.

1037
01:36:34,890 --> 01:36:39,350
But it can't be.
I was completely boggled, wasn't I?.

1038
01:36:40,850 --> 01:36:44,060
Right. Boggled.

1039
01:36:51,320 --> 01:36:52,570
Harry.

1040
01:36:54,030 --> 01:36:55,200
That's Katie.

1041
01:36:57,160 --> 01:36:58,790
Katie Bell.

1042
01:37:06,460 --> 01:37:08,830
Katie. How are you?.

1043
01:37:09,510 --> 01:37:14,000
I know you're going to ask, Harry,
but I don't know who cursed me.

1044
01:37:15,640 --> 01:37:19,170
I've been trying to remember, honestly.

1045
01:37:19,600 --> 01:37:23,020
But I just can't.

1046
01:37:36,280 --> 01:37:37,610
Katie?.

1047
01:38:20,080 --> 01:38:24,160
I know what you did, Malfoy.
You hexed her, didn't you?.

1048
01:38:54,530 --> 01:38:56,520
Sectumsempra!

1049
01:39:43,490 --> 01:39:46,410
Vulnera Sanentur.

1050
01:39:48,080 --> 01:39:50,910
Vulnera Sanentur.

1051
01:39:53,210 --> 01:39:56,080
Vulnera Sanentur.

1052
01:40:17,190 --> 01:40:20,720
You have to get rid of it. T oday.

1053
01:40:25,610 --> 01:40:27,240
T ake my hand.

1054
01:40:43,220 --> 01:40:45,120
The Room of Requirement.

1055
01:40:51,600 --> 01:40:54,220
We need to hide
the Half-Blood Prince's book...

1056
01:40:54,390 --> 01:40:58,090
...where no one will ever find it,
including you.

1057
01:41:06,450 --> 01:41:07,900
-What was that?.
-What was that?.

1058
01:41:34,010 --> 01:41:35,340
See?.

1059
01:41:35,890 --> 01:41:37,930
You never know what you'll find up here.

1060
01:41:57,080 --> 01:42:00,990
All right, close your eyes.
That way you can't be tempted.

1061
01:42:04,840 --> 01:42:06,540
Close your eyes.

1062
01:42:33,240 --> 01:42:36,110
That can stay hidden up here too,
if you like.

1063
01:42:50,760 --> 01:42:53,130
So did you and Ginny do it, then?.

1064
01:42:53,300 --> 01:42:54,460
What?.

1065
01:42:54,640 --> 01:42:56,710
You know, hide the book?.

1066
01:42:56,890 --> 01:42:58,760
oh, yeah.

1067
01:43:01,680 --> 01:43:04,260
Ah. Dear, yes.

1068
01:43:04,440 --> 01:43:07,220
Still no luck with Slughorn, then,
I take it?.

1069
01:43:09,270 --> 01:43:10,600
Luck.

1070
01:43:11,650 --> 01:43:14,990
That's it. All I need's a bit of luck.

1071
01:43:33,130 --> 01:43:36,330
Well, how do you feel?.

1072
01:43:36,510 --> 01:43:38,130
Excellent.

1073
01:43:39,300 --> 01:43:41,300
Really excellent.

1074
01:43:44,060 --> 01:43:45,640
Remember...

1075
01:43:45,980 --> 01:43:47,720
...Slughorn usually eats early...

1076
01:43:47,900 --> 01:43:50,900
...takes a walk,
and then returns to his office.

1077
01:43:51,070 --> 01:43:52,560
Right.

1078
01:43:52,980 --> 01:43:55,140
-I'm going down to Hagrid's.
-What?.

1079
01:43:55,320 --> 01:43:57,990
No, Harry, you've got to go
and speak to Slughorn.

1080
01:43:59,570 --> 01:44:02,150
-We have a plan.
I know...

1081
01:44:02,330 --> 01:44:04,400
...but I've got a
good feeling about Hagrid's.

1082
01:44:04,580 --> 01:44:08,330
I feel it's the place to be tonight.
Do you know what I mean?.

1083
01:44:09,210 --> 01:44:11,450
-No.
-Well, trust me, I know what I'm doing.

1084
01:44:11,630 --> 01:44:13,790
or Felix does.

1085
01:44:14,920 --> 01:44:16,420
Hi!

1086
01:44:47,040 --> 01:44:48,740
Merlin's beard, Harry!

1087
01:44:48,910 --> 01:44:53,040
Sorry, sir. I should've announced myself.
Cleared my throat, coughed.

1088
01:44:53,210 --> 01:44:55,170
You probably feared
I was Professor Sprout.

1089
01:44:55,340 --> 01:44:58,750
Yes, I did, actually.
What makes you think that?.

1090
01:44:58,920 --> 01:45:01,000
Well, just the general behavior, sir.

1091
01:45:01,180 --> 01:45:03,960
The sneaking around,
the jumping when you saw me.

1092
01:45:04,140 --> 01:45:07,720
Are those T entacula leaves, sir?.
They're very valuable, aren't they?.

1093
01:45:07,890 --> 01:45:10,220
Ten Galleons a leaf to the right buyer.

1094
01:45:10,390 --> 01:45:13,890
Not that I'm familiar with any such
transactions, but one does hear rumors.

1095
01:45:14,060 --> 01:45:17,850
My own interests
are purely academic, of course.

1096
01:45:18,030 --> 01:45:21,310
Personally, these plants
always kind of freaked me out.

1097
01:45:24,570 --> 01:45:26,730
How did you get out of the castle, Harry?.

1098
01:45:26,910 --> 01:45:28,400
Through the front door, sir.

1099
01:45:28,580 --> 01:45:30,740
I'm off to Hagrid's.
He's a very dear friend...

1100
01:45:30,910 --> 01:45:32,620
...and I fancied paying him a visit.

1101
01:45:32,790 --> 01:45:35,080
So if you don't mind,
I will be going now.

1102
01:45:35,880 --> 01:45:37,500
Harry!

1103
01:45:38,340 --> 01:45:40,790
-Sir?.
-It's nearly nightfall.

1104
01:45:40,960 --> 01:45:44,420
Surely you realize I can't allow you
to go roaming the grounds by yourself.

1105
01:45:44,590 --> 01:45:47,170
Well, then, by all means, come along, sir.

1106
01:45:52,520 --> 01:45:55,720
Harry, I must insist
you accompany me...

1107
01:45:55,900 --> 01:45:57,640
...back to the castle immediately!

1108
01:45:57,810 --> 01:46:01,060
That would be counterproductive, sir.

1109
01:46:02,400 --> 01:46:04,520
And what makes you say that?.

1110
01:46:05,610 --> 01:46:07,190
No idea.

1111
01:46:13,950 --> 01:46:15,370
Horace.

1112
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:21,290
Merlin's beard.
Is that an actual Acromantula?.

1113
01:46:21,880 --> 01:46:23,960
A dead one, I think, sir.

1114
01:46:24,760 --> 01:46:26,300
Good God.

1115
01:46:26,930 --> 01:46:30,010
Dear fellow,
however did you manage to kill it?.

1116
01:46:30,300 --> 01:46:33,760
Kill it?. Me oldest friend, he was.

1117
01:46:33,930 --> 01:46:38,140
-I'm so sorry, I didn't-
-Don't worry yourself, you're not alone.

1118
01:46:38,650 --> 01:46:42,100
Seriously misunderstood creatures,
spiders are.

1119
01:46:42,270 --> 01:46:44,480
It's the eyes, I reckon.
They unnerve some folk.

1120
01:46:44,900 --> 01:46:46,860
Not to mention the pincers.

1121
01:46:51,160 --> 01:46:53,120
Yeah, I reckon that too.

1122
01:46:53,830 --> 01:46:57,200
Hagrid, the last thing
I wish to be is indelicate...

1123
01:46:57,370 --> 01:47:01,450
...but Acromantular venom
is uncommonly rare.

1124
01:47:01,630 --> 01:47:03,830
Would you allow me
to extract a vial or two?.

1125
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:06,630
Purely for academic purposes,
you understand.

1126
01:47:06,800 --> 01:47:09,720
Well, I don't suppose it's going
to do him much good now, is it?.

1127
01:47:09,880 --> 01:47:11,080
My thoughts exactly.

1128
01:47:11,260 --> 01:47:17,760
AIways have a ampoule or two about
my person for just such occasions as this.

1129
01:47:18,020 --> 01:47:23,010
old Potions Master's habit, you know.

1130
01:47:23,690 --> 01:47:26,150
I wish you could've seen him
in his prime.

1131
01:47:26,320 --> 01:47:29,980
Magnificent, he was. Just magnificent.

1132
01:47:31,410 --> 01:47:32,980
oh, dear.

1133
01:47:42,710 --> 01:47:45,910
-Would you like me to say a few words?.
-Yes.

1134
01:47:46,170 --> 01:47:47,710
He had a family, I trust?.

1135
01:47:47,880 --> 01:47:49,370
oh, yeah.

1136
01:47:54,720 --> 01:47:56,210
Farewell...

1137
01:47:56,390 --> 01:47:58,260
Aragog.

1138
01:48:02,770 --> 01:48:05,690
Farewell, Aragog...

1139
01:48:06,060 --> 01:48:08,730
...king of the arachnids.

1140
01:48:09,570 --> 01:48:12,140
Your body will decay...

1141
01:48:13,400 --> 01:48:16,240
...but your spirit lingers on.

1142
01:48:16,950 --> 01:48:23,570
And your human friends find solace
in the loss they have sustained.

1143
01:48:38,760 --> 01:48:42,380
I had him from an egg, you know.
Tiny little thing he was when he hatched.

1144
01:48:42,560 --> 01:48:46,260
No bigger than a Pekinese.
A Pekinese, mind you.

1145
01:48:46,440 --> 01:48:51,600
How sweet. I once had a fish. Francis.
He was very dear to me.

1146
01:48:51,780 --> 01:48:56,940
one afternoon I came downstairs,
and he'd vanished.

1147
01:48:57,110 --> 01:48:58,690
Poof.

1148
01:48:58,870 --> 01:49:02,070
-That's very odd, isn't it?.
-It is, isn't it?.

1149
01:49:02,240 --> 01:49:05,940
But that's life, I suppose.

1150
01:49:06,120 --> 01:49:11,460
You go along and then suddenly, poof!

1151
01:49:11,630 --> 01:49:15,290
-Poof.
-Poof.

1152
01:49:29,850 --> 01:49:32,970
It was a student who gave me Francis.

1153
01:49:33,980 --> 01:49:38,280
one spring afternoon
I discovered a bowl on my desk...

1154
01:49:39,200 --> 01:49:42,150
...with just a few inches
of clear water in it.

1155
01:49:42,950 --> 01:49:46,490
And floating on the surface
was a flower petal.

1156
01:49:48,040 --> 01:49:50,490
As I watched, it sank.

1157
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:54,840
Just before it reached the bottom...

1158
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:56,460
...it transformed...

1159
01:49:57,840 --> 01:49:59,670
...into a wee fish.

1160
01:50:01,340 --> 01:50:03,470
It was beautiful magic.

1161
01:50:04,470 --> 01:50:06,710
Wondrous to behold.

1162
01:50:09,350 --> 01:50:12,100
The flower petal had come from a lily.

1163
01:50:14,480 --> 01:50:15,510
Your mother.

1164
01:50:17,570 --> 01:50:20,060
The day I came downstairs...

1165
01:50:21,030 --> 01:50:23,320
...the day the bowl was empty...

1166
01:50:24,870 --> 01:50:27,030
...was the day your mother...

1167
01:50:31,040 --> 01:50:33,030
I know why you're here.

1168
01:50:36,040 --> 01:50:38,040
But I can't help you.

1169
01:50:39,840 --> 01:50:41,550
It would ruin me.

1170
01:50:45,260 --> 01:50:47,720
Do you know why I survived, professor?.

1171
01:50:48,260 --> 01:50:50,090
The night I got this?.

1172
01:50:51,850 --> 01:50:53,480
Because of her.

1173
01:50:54,400 --> 01:50:56,190
Because she sacrificed herself.

1174
01:50:56,610 --> 01:50:58,980
Because she refused to step aside.

1175
01:50:59,150 --> 01:51:02,350
Because her love was more powerful
than Voldemort.

1176
01:51:02,530 --> 01:51:06,230
-Don't say his name.
-I'm not afraid of the name, professor.

1177
01:51:07,070 --> 01:51:09,200
I'm going to tell you something.

1178
01:51:10,120 --> 01:51:13,070
Something others have only guessed at.

1179
01:51:15,040 --> 01:51:16,530
It's true.

1180
01:51:17,130 --> 01:51:18,410
I am the Chosen One.

1181
01:51:19,420 --> 01:51:21,630
only I can destroy him,
but in order to do so...

1182
01:51:21,800 --> 01:51:25,080
...I need to know what T om Riddle
asked you years ago in your office...

1183
01:51:25,260 --> 01:51:27,630
...and I need to know what you told him.

1184
01:51:28,350 --> 01:51:30,750
Be brave, professor.

1185
01:51:32,390 --> 01:51:34,470
Be brave like my mother.

1186
01:51:35,770 --> 01:51:38,440
otherwise, you disgrace her.

1187
01:51:39,560 --> 01:51:41,850
otherwise, she died for nothing.

1188
01:51:42,860 --> 01:51:48,070
otherwise, the bowl
will remain empty forever.

1189
01:51:58,620 --> 01:52:01,740
Please, don't think badly of me
when you see it.

1190
01:52:03,750 --> 01:52:07,040
You've no idea what he was like,
even then.

1191
01:52:43,790 --> 01:52:46,500
I was in the library the other night...

1192
01:52:46,670 --> 01:52:48,830
...in the Restricted Section...

1193
01:52:49,720 --> 01:52:53,330
...and I read something rather odd
about a bit of rare magic.

1194
01:52:54,640 --> 01:52:57,390
It's called, as I understand it...

1195
01:52:58,680 --> 01:53:00,010
...a Horcrux.

1196
01:53:01,850 --> 01:53:04,610
-I beg your pardon?.
-Horcrux.

1197
01:53:05,020 --> 01:53:07,690
I came across the term while reading...

1198
01:53:07,860 --> 01:53:10,860
...and I didn't fully understand it.

1199
01:53:11,030 --> 01:53:12,770
I'm not sure what you
were reading, Tom...

1200
01:53:12,950 --> 01:53:15,520
...but this is very dark stuff,
very dark indeed.

1201
01:53:15,700 --> 01:53:17,240
Which is...

1202
01:53:18,370 --> 01:53:20,200
...why I came to you.

1203
01:53:23,040 --> 01:53:28,660
A Horcrux is an object in which a person
has concealed part of their soul.

1204
01:53:28,840 --> 01:53:31,460
But I don't understand
how that works, sir.

1205
01:53:34,050 --> 01:53:38,050
one splits one's soul and hides
part of it in an object.

1206
01:53:38,220 --> 01:53:41,840
By doing so, you're protected, should
you be attacked and your body destroyed.

1207
01:53:42,020 --> 01:53:43,130
Protected?.

1208
01:53:43,310 --> 01:53:46,510
That part of your soul
that is hidden lives on.

1209
01:53:47,980 --> 01:53:50,390
In other words, you cannot die.

1210
01:53:57,570 --> 01:54:00,740
And how does one split his soul, sir?.

1211
01:54:00,910 --> 01:54:03,700
I think you already know
the answer to that, T om.

1212
01:54:04,920 --> 01:54:06,410
Murder.

1213
01:54:06,920 --> 01:54:08,250
Yes.

1214
01:54:08,790 --> 01:54:13,700
Killing rips the soul apart.
It is a violation against nature.

1215
01:54:14,590 --> 01:54:19,340
Can you only split the soul
once?. For instance, isn't seven...?.

1216
01:54:19,510 --> 01:54:21,010
Seven?.

1217
01:54:21,760 --> 01:54:27,060
Merlin's beard, T om. Isn't it bad enough
to consider killing one person?.

1218
01:54:27,230 --> 01:54:30,980
T o rip the soul into seven pieces...

1219
01:54:32,150 --> 01:54:35,190
This is all hypothetical, isn't it, T om?.
All academic?.

1220
01:54:39,950 --> 01:54:41,280
of course, sir.

1221
01:54:44,250 --> 01:54:46,240
It'll be our little secret.

1222
01:54:55,050 --> 01:54:56,290
Sir.

1223
01:55:11,690 --> 01:55:13,810
This is beyond anything I imagined.

1224
01:55:13,980 --> 01:55:16,650
You mean to say he succeeded, sir,
in making a Horcrux?.

1225
01:55:16,820 --> 01:55:19,940
oh, yes, he succeeded, all right.
And not just once.

1226
01:55:20,110 --> 01:55:21,140
What are they exactly?.

1227
01:55:21,320 --> 01:55:24,660
Could be anything.
Most commonplace of objects.

1228
01:55:27,830 --> 01:55:29,540
A ring, for example.

1229
01:55:30,160 --> 01:55:31,660
or a book.

1230
01:55:32,960 --> 01:55:35,330
-T om Riddle's diary.
-It's a Horcrux, yes.

1231
01:55:35,840 --> 01:55:37,960
Four years ago, when you saved
Ginny's life...

1232
01:55:38,130 --> 01:55:40,420
...in the Chamber of Secrets,
you brought me this.

1233
01:55:40,590 --> 01:55:42,500
I knew this was
a different kind of magic.

1234
01:55:42,680 --> 01:55:47,670
Very dark, very powerful. But until tonight
I had no idea just how powerful.

1235
01:55:47,850 --> 01:55:49,840
-The ring?.
-Belonged to Voldemort's mother.

1236
01:55:50,230 --> 01:55:54,970
Difficult to find.
Even more difficult to destroy.

1237
01:55:55,150 --> 01:55:59,020
But if you could find them all,
if you did destroy each Horcrux...

1238
01:55:59,190 --> 01:56:00,360
one destroys Voldemort.

1239
01:56:00,530 --> 01:56:03,450
But how would you find them?.
They could be hidden anywhere.

1240
01:56:03,610 --> 01:56:06,860
True. But magic, especially dark magic...

1241
01:56:20,840 --> 01:56:22,710
...leaves traces.

1242
01:56:30,520 --> 01:56:32,590
It's where you've been going,
isn't it, sir?.

1243
01:56:32,770 --> 01:56:35,060
-When you leave the school?.
-Yes.

1244
01:56:35,900 --> 01:56:38,980
And I think perhaps
I may have found another.

1245
01:56:39,150 --> 01:56:43,230
But this time,
I cannot hope to destroy it alone.

1246
01:56:44,780 --> 01:56:49,440
once again,
I must ask too much of you, Harry.

1247
01:56:53,410 --> 01:56:55,700
Have you ever considered
that you ask too much...

1248
01:56:55,870 --> 01:56:58,500
...that you take too much for granted?.

1249
01:56:58,670 --> 01:57:03,710
Has it ever crossed your brilliant mind
that I don't want to do this anymore?.

1250
01:57:03,880 --> 01:57:06,000
Whether it has or hasn't is irrelevant.

1251
01:57:06,880 --> 01:57:12,670
I will not negotiate with you, Severus.
You agreed. Nothing more to discuss.

1252
01:57:31,070 --> 01:57:32,700
oh, Harry.

1253
01:57:35,290 --> 01:57:37,610
You need a shave, my friend.

1254
01:57:40,420 --> 01:57:44,630
You know, at times,
I forget how much you've grown.

1255
01:57:44,800 --> 01:57:48,750
At times, I still see the small boy
from the cupboard.

1256
01:57:50,300 --> 01:57:52,670
Forgive my mawkishness, Harry.

1257
01:57:53,140 --> 01:57:54,630
I'm an old man.

1258
01:57:54,810 --> 01:57:56,470
You still look the same to me, sir.

1259
01:57:57,930 --> 01:58:00,940
Just like your mother,
you're unfailingly kind.

1260
01:58:01,100 --> 01:58:04,310
A trait people never fail to undervalue,
I'm afraid.

1261
01:58:07,070 --> 01:58:11,560
The place to which we journey tonight
is extremely dangerous.

1262
01:58:11,740 --> 01:58:15,240
I promised you could accompany me,
and I stand by that promise.

1263
01:58:15,410 --> 01:58:17,240
But there is one condition:

1264
01:58:17,410 --> 01:58:20,610
You must obey every command
I give you, without question.

1265
01:58:21,500 --> 01:58:23,120
Yes, sir.

1266
01:58:23,290 --> 01:58:25,420
You do understand what I'm saying?.

1267
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:28,490
Should I tell you to hide, you hide.

1268
01:58:28,670 --> 01:58:31,000
Should I tell you to run, you run.

1269
01:58:31,180 --> 01:58:35,170
Should I tell you to abandon me
and save yourself, you must do so.

1270
01:58:40,350 --> 01:58:41,930
Your word, Harry.

1271
01:58:43,560 --> 01:58:45,060
My word.

1272
01:58:45,860 --> 01:58:47,520
Take my arm.

1273
01:58:48,940 --> 01:58:51,350
Sir, I thought you couldn't
Apparate within Hogwarts.

1274
01:58:52,030 --> 01:58:55,480
Well, being me has its privileges.

1275
01:59:42,750 --> 01:59:44,370
This is the place.

1276
01:59:45,160 --> 01:59:46,740
oh, yes.

1277
01:59:47,670 --> 01:59:50,240
This place has known magic.

1278
01:59:58,260 --> 01:59:59,800
-Sir!
-In order to gain passage...

1279
01:59:59,970 --> 02:00:01,380
...payment must be made.

1280
02:00:01,560 --> 02:00:05,170
Payment intended
to weaken any intruder.

1281
02:00:06,770 --> 02:00:08,600
-You should've let me, sir.
-No, Harry.

1282
02:00:09,060 --> 02:00:11,770
Your blood's much more precious
than mine.

1283
02:00:33,670 --> 02:00:38,300
Voldemort will not have made it easy
to discover his hiding place.

1284
02:00:38,470 --> 02:00:41,800
He will have put certain defenses
in position.

1285
02:00:44,390 --> 02:00:45,800
Careful.

1286
02:01:09,330 --> 02:01:10,440
There it is.

1287
02:01:11,960 --> 02:01:14,660
The only question is,
how do we get there?.

1288
02:01:36,860 --> 02:01:38,680
If you would, Harry.

1289
02:02:25,990 --> 02:02:28,400
Do you think the Horcrux is in there, sir?.

1290
02:02:29,030 --> 02:02:30,410
oh, yes.

1291
02:02:41,500 --> 02:02:43,080
It has to be drunk.

1292
02:02:43,250 --> 02:02:46,090
All of it has to be drunk.

1293
02:02:46,930 --> 02:02:50,260
You remember the conditions on which
I brought you with me?.

1294
02:02:50,430 --> 02:02:52,840
This potion might paralyze me.

1295
02:02:53,260 --> 02:02:54,920
Might make me forget why I'm here.

1296
02:02:55,730 --> 02:02:59,010
Might cause me so much pain
that I beg for relief.

1297
02:02:59,270 --> 02:03:01,180
You are not to indulge these requests.

1298
02:03:01,360 --> 02:03:04,890
It's your job, Harry, to make sure
I keep drinking this potion.

1299
02:03:05,070 --> 02:03:07,520
Even if you have to force it
down my throat.

1300
02:03:07,990 --> 02:03:10,110
-Understood?.
-Why can't I drink it, sir?.

1301
02:03:10,280 --> 02:03:15,700
Because I am much older, much cleverer,
and much less valuable.

1302
02:03:19,620 --> 02:03:21,700
Your good health, Harry.

1303
02:03:37,850 --> 02:03:39,130
Professor.

1304
02:03:41,270 --> 02:03:42,470
Professor!

1305
02:03:49,150 --> 02:03:50,650
Harry.

1306
02:03:50,820 --> 02:03:53,310
Professor, can you hear me?.

1307
02:03:54,620 --> 02:03:55,780
Professor.

1308
02:04:11,220 --> 02:04:12,330
No. Don't.

1309
02:04:12,510 --> 02:04:14,830
You have to keep drinking,
like you said. Remember?.

1310
02:04:24,100 --> 02:04:25,980
Stop.
-It will stop. It will stop...

1311
02:04:26,150 --> 02:04:30,560
-...but only if you keep drinking.
-Please, don't make me.

1312
02:04:30,730 --> 02:04:32,860
-I'm sorry, sir.
-Please.

1313
02:04:33,030 --> 02:04:35,320
-Kill me. Kill me!
-No!

1314
02:04:37,240 --> 02:04:38,320
It's my fault.

1315
02:04:39,990 --> 02:04:41,190
It's all my fault.

1316
02:04:43,040 --> 02:04:44,660
It's my fault.

1317
02:04:44,830 --> 02:04:48,200
Just one more, sir.
one more, and then I promise...

1318
02:04:48,880 --> 02:04:51,200
...I promise I'll do what you say.

1319
02:04:51,380 --> 02:04:53,210
-I promise.
-No.

1320
02:04:54,260 --> 02:04:55,630
Please.

1321
02:05:19,780 --> 02:05:21,240
Harry.

1322
02:05:28,370 --> 02:05:29,410
Water.

1323
02:05:30,420 --> 02:05:31,530
Water.

1324
02:05:31,710 --> 02:05:33,500
Water.

1325
02:05:40,010 --> 02:05:41,800
You did it, sir.

1326
02:05:41,970 --> 02:05:43,430
Look.

1327
02:05:45,430 --> 02:05:46,680
Harry.

1328
02:05:48,060 --> 02:05:49,390
Water.

1329
02:05:51,150 --> 02:05:52,810
Aguamenti.

1330
02:05:53,020 --> 02:05:54,480
Water.

1331
02:06:30,640 --> 02:06:32,020
Lumos.

1332
02:07:00,460 --> 02:07:02,370
Lumos Maxima!

1333
02:07:11,850 --> 02:07:13,680
Harry.

1334
02:07:17,730 --> 02:07:18,850
Sectumsempra!

1335
02:07:19,020 --> 02:07:20,190
Harry.

1336
02:07:21,150 --> 02:07:22,780
-Stupefy!
Harry.

1337
02:08:21,960 --> 02:08:23,240
Harry.

1338
02:08:27,260 --> 02:08:29,580
Partis Temporus!

1339
02:09:12,130 --> 02:09:15,250
Go to your houses. No dawdling.

1340
02:09:56,090 --> 02:09:59,790
We need to get you to the hospital
wing, sir, to Madam Pomfrey.

1341
02:10:02,230 --> 02:10:03,600
No.

1342
02:10:04,640 --> 02:10:07,310
Severus. Severus is who I need.

1343
02:10:07,480 --> 02:10:11,020
Wake him. Tell him what happened.

1344
02:10:11,190 --> 02:10:12,850
Speak to no one else.

1345
02:10:13,490 --> 02:10:15,690
Severus, Harry.

1346
02:10:20,990 --> 02:10:23,400
Hide yourself below, Harry.

1347
02:10:24,870 --> 02:10:27,870
Don't speak or be seen by anybody
without my permission.

1348
02:10:28,040 --> 02:10:31,830
Whatever happens,
it's imperative you stay below.

1349
02:10:32,630 --> 02:10:34,290
Harry, do as I say.

1350
02:10:37,930 --> 02:10:39,210
Trust me.

1351
02:10:40,970 --> 02:10:42,430
Trust me.

1352
02:11:02,990 --> 02:11:04,820
Good evening, Draco.

1353
02:11:05,700 --> 02:11:09,240
What brings you here
on this fine spring evening?.

1354
02:11:09,420 --> 02:11:11,160
Who else is here?. I heard you talking.

1355
02:11:11,330 --> 02:11:15,410
I often talk aloud to
myself. I find it extraordinarily useful.

1356
02:11:17,550 --> 02:11:20,380
Have you been whispering
to yourself, Draco?.

1357
02:11:22,890 --> 02:11:24,350
Draco...

1358
02:11:25,010 --> 02:11:27,970
-...you are no assassin.
-How do you know what I am?.

1359
02:11:28,140 --> 02:11:29,930
I've done things that would shock you.

1360
02:11:30,100 --> 02:11:34,230
Like cursing Katie Bell and hoping that in
return she'd bear a cursed necklace to me?.

1361
02:11:34,400 --> 02:11:37,020
Replacing a bottle of mead
with one laced with poison?.

1362
02:11:37,190 --> 02:11:38,770
Forgive me, Draco.

1363
02:11:38,940 --> 02:11:41,440
I cannot help feeling these actions
are so weak...

1364
02:11:41,610 --> 02:11:43,990
...your heart can't really
have been in them.

1365
02:11:44,160 --> 02:11:47,360
He trusts me. I was chosen.

1366
02:11:51,170 --> 02:11:52,960
Then I shall make it easy for you.

1367
02:11:53,130 --> 02:11:54,790
Expelliarmus!

1368
02:11:58,130 --> 02:12:00,460
Very good. Very good.

1369
02:12:02,220 --> 02:12:03,680
You're not alone.

1370
02:12:04,760 --> 02:12:05,790
There are others.

1371
02:12:07,850 --> 02:12:09,260
How?.

1372
02:12:10,560 --> 02:12:13,230
The vanishing cabinet
in the Room of Requirement.

1373
02:12:13,980 --> 02:12:16,350
-I've been mending it.
Let me guess.

1374
02:12:16,520 --> 02:12:19,480
It has a sister. A twin.

1375
02:12:19,650 --> 02:12:21,860
In Borgin and Burkes.
They form a passage.

1376
02:12:22,030 --> 02:12:23,820
Ingenious.

1377
02:12:24,490 --> 02:12:25,730
Draco...

1378
02:12:25,910 --> 02:12:31,990
...years ago, I knew a boy
who made all the wrong choices.

1379
02:12:32,910 --> 02:12:35,830
-Please let me help you.
-I don't want your help!

1380
02:12:36,630 --> 02:12:40,130
Don't you understand?. I have to do this.

1381
02:12:41,340 --> 02:12:43,000
I have to kill you.

1382
02:12:43,630 --> 02:12:45,670
or he's gonna kill me.

1383
02:12:55,190 --> 02:12:58,800
Well, look what we have here.

1384
02:13:00,690 --> 02:13:02,850
Well done, Draco.

1385
02:13:06,530 --> 02:13:08,360
Good evening, Bellatrix.

1386
02:13:09,410 --> 02:13:11,570
I think introductions
are in order, don't you?.

1387
02:13:11,740 --> 02:13:16,870
Love to, AIbus, but I'm afraid
we're all on a bit of a tight schedule.

1388
02:13:17,500 --> 02:13:18,870
Do it.

1389
02:13:20,170 --> 02:13:24,300
He doesn't have the stomach,
just like his father.

1390
02:13:24,710 --> 02:13:26,210
Let me finish him in my own way.

1391
02:13:26,380 --> 02:13:30,000
No! The Dark Lord was clear,
the boy is to do it.

1392
02:13:30,180 --> 02:13:32,220
This is your moment. Do it.

1393
02:13:33,770 --> 02:13:35,760
Go on, Draco.

1394
02:13:35,930 --> 02:13:38,090
Now!

1395
02:13:39,350 --> 02:13:40,680
No.

1396
02:13:52,580 --> 02:13:54,120
Severus.

1397
02:14:03,130 --> 02:14:04,590
Please.

1398
02:14:05,590 --> 02:14:06,920
Avada Kedavra.

1399
02:14:49,880 --> 02:14:53,130
Yeah!

1400
02:15:11,320 --> 02:15:14,770
Hagrid! Hello?.

1401
02:15:14,950 --> 02:15:18,990
Snape! He trusted you!

1402
02:15:23,330 --> 02:15:24,960
Go on.

1403
02:15:25,620 --> 02:15:27,330
Incarcerous.

1404
02:15:27,500 --> 02:15:30,170
Fight back! You coward, fight back!

1405
02:15:31,800 --> 02:15:35,000
No! He belongs to the Dark Lord.

1406
02:15:55,150 --> 02:15:56,530
Sectumsempra!

1407
02:16:05,000 --> 02:16:10,240
You dare use my own spells
against me, Potter?.

1408
02:16:11,000 --> 02:16:12,160
Yes.

1409
02:16:12,880 --> 02:16:17,040
I' m the Half-Blood Prince.

1410
02:20:05,110 --> 02:20:06,560
McGONAGALL:
Potter...

1411
02:20:07,270 --> 02:20:09,770
...in light of what has happened...

1412
02:20:11,200 --> 02:20:14,480
...if you should have the need
to talk to someone...

1413
02:20:16,450 --> 02:20:20,450
You should know,
Professor Dumbledore...

1414
02:20:22,290 --> 02:20:24,740
...you meant a great deal to him.

1415
02:20:43,020 --> 02:20:45,180
Do you think he would've done it?.

1416
02:20:45,350 --> 02:20:47,230
Draco?.

1417
02:20:48,310 --> 02:20:49,640
No.

1418
02:20:50,820 --> 02:20:52,860
No, he was lowering his wand.

1419
02:20:53,900 --> 02:20:55,860
In the end, it was Snape.

1420
02:20:56,490 --> 02:20:58,950
It was always Snape.

1421
02:20:59,120 --> 02:21:01,320
And I did nothing.

1422
02:21:08,000 --> 02:21:09,410
It's fake.

1423
02:21:11,000 --> 02:21:12,330
open it.

1424
02:21:23,350 --> 02:21:27,350
"To the Dark Lord. I know I will be dead
long before you read this...

1425
02:21:27,520 --> 02:21:31,180
...but I want you to know that it was I
who discovered your secret.

1426
02:21:32,190 --> 02:21:36,060
I have stolen the real Horcrux and intend
to destroy it as soon as I can.

1427
02:21:36,240 --> 02:21:39,270
I face death in the hope that
when you meet your match...

1428
02:21:39,450 --> 02:21:41,690
...you will be mortal once more.

1429
02:21:42,990 --> 02:21:44,650
R.A.B. "

1430
02:21:45,910 --> 02:21:47,370
R.A.B.

1431
02:21:47,750 --> 02:21:49,030
Don't know.

1432
02:21:51,040 --> 02:21:53,710
But whoever they are,
they have the real Horcrux.

1433
02:21:54,670 --> 02:21:56,210
Which means it was all a waste.

1434
02:21:57,550 --> 02:21:59,040
All of it.

1435
02:22:05,270 --> 02:22:07,340
Ron's okay with it, you know.

1436
02:22:07,850 --> 02:22:09,350
You and Ginny.

1437
02:22:09,980 --> 02:22:13,680
But if I were you, when he's around,
I'd keep the snogging to a minimum.

1438
02:22:15,020 --> 02:22:17,020
I'm not coming back, Hermione.

1439
02:22:18,190 --> 02:22:20,900
I've got to finish
whatever Dumbledore started.

1440
02:22:21,070 --> 02:22:23,910
And I don't know where that'll lead me...

1441
02:22:24,080 --> 02:22:27,690
...but I'll let you and Ron know
where I am when I can.

1442
02:22:29,040 --> 02:22:31,660
I've always admired your courage, Harry.

1443
02:22:31,830 --> 02:22:34,500
But sometimes, you can be really thick.

1444
02:22:37,550 --> 02:22:39,790
You don't really think
you're going to be able...

1445
02:22:39,970 --> 02:22:42,340
...to find all those Horcruxes
by yourself, do you?.

1446
02:22:46,600 --> 02:22:48,260
You need us, Harry.

1447
02:23:04,070 --> 02:23:07,160
I never realized
how beautiful this place was.
