a way to "turn it off on this video I want it uncut" useful for reviewing...

"unknown" is still possible if they don't re-save :(
  move cats inline, it's the only hope...

== pre launch ==

add your emails to our system, not just session
  it remembers who you are in our DB ... 
  change logs to just say user ID...no handle needed?
  I like handle though... :| just a link to adjust it :|

more personlized edit lists, everybody wants to be able to edit their own private...yeah...
  checkboxes/select all 
  we have a link for it, so should take care of this [plus better link]
  just "one per user" for now?
  an option to see all details?

main page groom persuasive/awesome/catchy [nik?]

    it didn't show everything yet? :|

== meh, but yes, someday, unordered ===
put logout into top header

amazon third url...ai ai...adaline...

add youtube preview ID :|

"the choice" had one unknown profanity seemingly :|

on amazon previews it says "success!..." LOL

allow user reviews [star rating, other rating, every rating is a single rating] synopsis?

more pay me donation options/amazon reseller account...
  focus on "getting paying people" LOL

the "give a free one away to get a credit" promo

seasons have their own page, really [so one link]

easier/some kind of "contact us" ...

better thumbnail images :|

== todo never LOL ==

does not every tag want that age param?? maybe OK for now

add year with dropdown [?]
  low prior for now let's hope mclintock was a freak...
  year is still barely kind of useful to people though...
  yeah prefer dropdown...  low priority

do we need more things people can enter in, like what common sense media has 3 different things?
add SD price (if anybody else requests it)
new icon for the chrome plugin [various?]
some way to prevent vandalism? history...
test roku stream from desktop? LOL :|
shut down server more gracefully for restarts than hard kill :|
it "auto gets" the series name wrong for Star Trek TNG season 1
allow multiple genres per movie
Amazon add-on prime appears wrong in index
even more profanity scanning list files somewhere?
series -> their own page [so you can just review that instead...]
"auto get" amazon second url, prime type for series' 

private list of edits are shareable...or does that only make sense in the other model?
prettier url's than https://playitmyway.inet2.org/view_url/97
during adds show "nothing" somehow...or less...youtube 15.'s but it's not enough...
resurrect "fake" netflix playback :|
youtube for .srt [also make it its own page whoa] it is waaaay complicated today :|
  but just for volunteers so lower-ish priority :)
some way to disable it on youtube...or not track things? disable verywhere?
logout say something like "successfully logged out, click here if you'd like to disable one click login"
can filter previews/trailers *based on duration* woot

"remember" which ones they chose last [?] for their kids to default to a good one...

personalized uneditable content lists?

more market research...maybe?

sortable index?
  once I get started :)
  prettier?

general website feedback
go to the test movie, add it, add details. https://playitmyway.inet2.org/test_movie.html

CBS has a subscription offering

more: crackle, showtime anywhere, mgo, youtube movies

which ones do people *care about* or *actually use* though? LOL

== which movies to screen'ish ==

2750 amazon reviews or 10K  + LOL
50K imdb? 75K :|

== random ==

firefox mobile + agent adjuster for...tablet playback? Except what I really want is Roku...so maybe...HTPC that can run chrome [linux?] hrm...

== business ==

"dp" is newer for amazon vs. gp hmm...

one free per month, otherwise choose your donation-level?
     offer money if they find/want to do new one LOL. $2 $5 ? yeah simpler on my head LOL
        $1 to check one/refine/tweak?
  definitely liking the free month
    so basically paywall this thing <waaah>
  TODO business survey :|

or "skew you, I'm going to pay through the nose for this thing"
  "if you want to donate to support, please do so by clicking here"
  I actually like this way too :)

== kemal notes ==
database with kemal:

https://github.com/sdogruyol/kemal-pg-sample/blob/master/src/app.cr (raw postgres...)

https://gist.github.com/rdp/f099508e26934d20938c4ffe37ee3298
connection pool, mysql...

it's actually using the pool right which is good...

other pool: https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal-db/blob/master/src/db/pool.cr

crystal-db only works with sqlite, mysql

I can use pools later, just open and close them for now [?] 
  what the...
   
 
I think "DB" is the main central DB fella...
  this is terrifying...I mean it feels like you'll have threading issues immediately and *everywhere* LOL


auth: filter
before_all do |env|
 raise "Unauthorized" unless authorized?(env)
end



before_all "/" do |env|
  puts "Setting response content type"
  env.response.content_type = "application/json"
end

db = ConnectionPool.new(capacity: 25, timeout: 0.01) do # its either this or open it raw yourself each method :|
  DB.open(ENV["DATABASE_URL"]) # only strings :|
end

before_get "/" do |env|
  env.set "is_kemal_cool", true
end

it needs some kind of session object store so you can store more than just strings in the env :|



== web server framework==

kemal or amethyst 

amethyst 2015?? assume dead :|

kemal is the only maintained one? LOL

kemal replaces moonshine

frost (too old/toast/unmaintained'ish ? )

toro == kemal but created 2016
  one of them [?]
  sooo confusing :|

== db ==

https://github.com/waterlink/active_record.cr

https://github.com/juanedi/micrate db migration :|

== netflix javascript ==

they call "setState" or some odd :| on something...hrm...

widevine?

error code m7375

fail windows 10 FF, IE, Chrome [html5]

ubuntu: normal FF silverlight

video_element has height

 playback klayer-ns playback-wrapper is above it...

 scrubber head klayer-ns surface  
 is the little dragger :|
 or scrubber target

so maybe coudl fake a seek there...I mean maybe LOL.

netflix remotes around???

https://www.stephanboyer.com/post/105/netflix-party-synchronize-netflix-video-playback


netflix remote app... [?]
netflix windows app? ... [?]

hack firefox so that one can enumerate over all objects in the whole land somehow???

window.netflix.cadmium.UiEvents.fireEvent ?? :|

smart phone/tablets/android etc: I think chrome is the only thing with widevine [that NFI needs?]
   so...I mean there was a link somewhere once about it but...
   either hope for plugins or...hack their binary [yikes?]
    or ask for them to support it natively [already did'ish...]
    or playon.tv/cast'ing it [?]
  probaly just provide a custom "rent a box" application for it (VPS) and RDP into it...
