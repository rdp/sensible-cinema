<h1>Clean Editing Movie Player</h1></div>
<pre>
The CEMP allows you watch edited movies by applying edit lists (EDL's -- edit decision lists) 
(i.e. "mute out" or "cut out" questionable scenes) to DVD's or movie files.

A description and history/background of sensible-cinema can be found <a href="https://github.com/rdp/sensible-cinema/blob/master/README">here</a>.  
Don't forget to come back to this page to download it, though (from the "Download" section, below).

<h2 style="margin: 0px;">Download</h2>
To download, please check the checkbox if you agree to the terms of the 
license agreement (<a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.html">lgpl</a>) and wish to download and use sensible cinema.  

<input type="checkbox" class="trigger" onClick="$('#comments').toggle();"/>  I have read and agree to the license terms and conditions and wish to download.

<div id="comments" style="display:none;  border-style:dotted; border-width:1px; border-color: #aaaaaa; padding: 5px;"> 
  Please download the latest version of sensible cinema from <a href="https://bintray.com/rdp/sensible-cinema/sensible-cinema">bintray</a>.
  <br/>
  You can also see the <a href="source">source</a>.
  <br/>
  You can also see the what's new <a href="https://github.com/rdp/sensible-cinema/blob/master/change_log_with_feature_list.txt">ChangeLog</a>.
</div>
After download, for windows, run the installer exe file.
For mac, unzip it.

You will be initially prompted to accept the license agreement(s) and also install a few 
(non included, separate ownership/distribution) dependencies.
Now insert a DVD you own, to see available options.
There is more documentation <a href="https://github.com/rdp/sensible-cinema/wiki">here</a>.

<h3>Mac user prerequisites</h3>Mac users will need to install some <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/mplayer-edl/files/mac-dependencies/">mac dependencies</a> first.  NB to uninstall them, should you ever desire to, open a terminal and carefully run this: $ sudo rm -rf /opt/rdp_project_local

Note that by installing these dependencies, you're accepting their respective licenses/distributions.

<h3>Available edited movie lists</h3>You can see the (small) current list of DVD edit lists (EDL's) already created
<a href="https://github.com/rdp/sensible-cinema/tree/master/zamples/edit_decision_lists/dvds">here</a> 
(all of them created previously by volunteers like you, or myself).  
If your movie is already there, then you might be ready to go.  Use the one that's already there and give feedback on it when you're done.

If yours isn't there, then we'd ask you to help us by creating and submitting your own EDL (delete/cut list) for your DVD that doesn't have one yet, 
see the <a href="https://github.com/rdp/sensible-cinema/wiki">documentation on the wiki</a> for instructions on creating 
your own new delete list. <!-- this is actually a short line -->
Then run the file "advanced-edit or create sensible cinema delete list files.bat" to create and edit your new delete list.  
CEM Player has a few buttons to help you there.
Don't forget to upload your new EDL file back to us when you're done, so others can benefit (see "contact", below).

That link is the full list--your help is wanted/needed to help us grow!
